## The Kannada Script

- 13 vowels (swaras)
- 34 consonants (vyanjanas)
- Special characters and numerals

## Vowels (ಸ್ವರಗಳು / Swaragalu)
| Letter | Transliteration | English Approximation |
|--------|----------------|------------------------|
| ಅ | a | a in "about" |
| ಆ | ā | a in "father" |
| ಇ | i | i in "sit" |
| ಈ | ī | ee in "see" |

## Some Common Consonants (ವ್ಯಂಜನಗಳು / Vyanjanagalu)

## Combining Vowels and Consonants
In Kannada, when vowels combine with consonants, the vowel symbols change to diacritical marks. For example:

- ಕ (ka) + ಆ (ā) = ಕಾ (kā)
- ಕ (ka) + ಇ (i) = ಕಿ (ki)
- ಕ (ka) + ಉ (u) = ಕು (ku)

## Practice Exercise
Try to identify these Kannada letters:
1. ನ
2. ಮ
3. ಕು
4. ಸ
5. ರಿ

## Key Points
- Kannada script is read from left to right
- Each consonant inherently includes the short vowel 'a' sound
- Special symbols called vowel markers are used to change this inherent vowel
- Practice writing these characters to gain familiarity with the script
