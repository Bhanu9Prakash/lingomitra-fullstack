## Lesson 5: Saying Hello & Goodbye - Kannada Greetings (ಶುಭಾಶಯಗಳು - shubhaashayagaLu)

Greetings are your entry point into any conversation! Kannada has various ways to greet people depending on the time of day, formality, and context. Let's learn the most common expressions.

### Basic Greetings

These are the most versatile ways to greet someone in Kannada:

| English | Kannada | Transliteration | Pronunciation | Usage Note |
|---------|---------|-----------------|--------------|------------|
| Hello/Greetings | ನಮಸ್ಕಾರ | namaskara | na-mas-kaa-ra | The most universal greeting, appropriate in all situations |
| Hello (informal) | ಹಲೋ | hello | ha-lo | Borrowed from English, used among younger people in urban areas |
| Hello (affectionate) | ಏನಪ್ಪ/ಏನಮ್ಮ | enappa/enamma | ay-na-ppa/ay-na-mma | Used with younger people, appa (for males) and amma (for females) |

For **ನಮಸ್ಕಾರ** (namaskara), you might see people joining their palms in a prayer-like gesture (called ನಮಸ್ತೆ - namaste), especially in more formal or traditional settings.

### Time-Specific Greetings

Kannada also has greetings based on the time of day:

| English | Kannada | Transliteration | Pronunciation | Time of Day |
|---------|---------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Good morning | ಶುಭೋದಯ | shubhodaya | shu-bho-da-ya | Until about 11 AM |
| Good morning (lit. "morning greetings") | ಬೆಳಗಿನ ಶುಭಾಶಯಗಳು | belagina shubhaashayagaLu | be-la-gi-na shu-bhaa-sha-ya-ga-Lu | Until late morning |
| Good afternoon | ಶುಭ ಮಧ್ಯಾಹ್ನ | shubha madhyaahna | shu-bha madh-yaah-na | From noon to early evening |
| Good evening | ಶುಭ ಸಂಜೆ | shubha sanje | shu-bha san-je | Late afternoon/evening |
| Good night | ಶುಭ ರಾತ್ರಿ | shubha raatri | shu-bha raa-tri | When someone is going to sleep |

Note that while these time-specific greetings exist, they're used less frequently than ನಮಸ್ಕಾರ (namaskara), which works throughout the day.

### Asking "How Are You?"

After greeting someone, it's common to ask how they're doing:

| English | Kannada | Transliteration | Pronunciation | Note |
|---------|---------|-----------------|--------------|------|
| How are you? (formal) | ಹೇಗಿದ್ದೀರಿ? | heegiddeeri? | hay-gi-ddee-ri | Used with elders or people you don't know well |
| How are you? (informal) | ಹೇಗಿದ್ದೀಯ? | heegiddeeya? | hay-gi-ddee-ya | Used with friends, younger people |
| How are you? (general) | ಹೇಗಿದೆ? | heegide? | hay-gi-de | Can be used in most situations |
| Are you well? | ಚೆನ್ನಾಗಿದ್ದೀರಾ? | chennaagiddeera? | chen-naa-gi-ddee-ra | More specific about well-being |

**Response options:**

| English | Kannada | Transliteration | Note |
|---------|---------|-----------------|------|
| I'm fine | ನಾನು ಚೆನ್ನಾಗಿದ್ದೇನೆ | naanu chennaagiddeene | Standard response |
| I'm good, thank you | ಚೆನ್ನಾಗಿದೆ, ಧನ್ಯವಾದಗಳು | chennaagide, dhanyavaadagaLu | More casual |
| And you? | ನೀವು ಹೇಗಿದ್ದೀರಿ? / ನೀನು ಹೇಗಿದ್ದೀಯ? | neevu heegiddeeri? / neenu heegiddeeya? | Formal/informal distinction |

### Saying Goodbye

Here are common ways to say goodbye in Kannada:

| English | Kannada | Transliteration | Pronunciation | Usage |
|---------|---------|-----------------|--------------|-------|
| Goodbye (formal) | ಹೋಗಿ ಬರುತ್ತೇನೆ | hoogi barutteene | ho-gi ba-ru-ttee-ne | Lit. "I'll go and come back" - formal parting |
| Goodbye (casual) | ಮತ್ತೆ ಸಿಗೋಣ | matte sigoNa | ma-tte si-go-Na | "Let's meet again" - friendly, casual |
| See you later | ಮತ್ತೆ ನೋಡೋಣ | matte nooDoNa | ma-tte noo-Do-Na | "Let's see again" - casual |
| See you tomorrow | ನಾಳೆ ಸಿಗೋಣ | naaLe sigoNa | naa-Le si-go-Na | "Let's meet tomorrow" |
| Goodbye (when leaving) | ಹೋಗುತ್ತೇನೆ | hoogutteene | ho-gu-ttee-ne | "I'm going" - when you're the one leaving |
| Take care | ಜಾಗ್ರತೆ | jaagrate | jaa-gra-te | When showing concern |

### Thanking and Responding

Being polite is important in any language:

| English | Kannada | Transliteration | Pronunciation |
|---------|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| Thank you | ಧನ್ಯವಾದಗಳು | dhanyavaadagaLu | dhan-ya-vaa-da-ga-Lu |
| Thank you (more formal) | ತುಂಬಾ ಧನ್ಯವಾದಗಳು | tumbaa dhanyavaadagaLu | tum-baa dhan-ya-vaa-da-ga-Lu |
| You're welcome | ಪರವಾಗಿಲ್ಲ | paravaagilla | pa-ra-vaa-gi-lla |

### Formal vs. Informal: A Summary

Kannada distinguishes between formal and informal speech:

| Situation | Greeting Example | Pronoun to Use |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Formal** (Elders, officials, strangers, teachers) | ನಮಸ್ಕಾರ, ಹೇಗಿದ್ದೀರಿ? (namaskara, heegiddeeri?) | ನೀವು (neevu) - formal "you" |
| **Informal** (Friends, younger people, family) | ಏನಪ್ಪ/ಏನಮ್ಮ, ಹೇಗಿದ್ದೀಯ? (enappa/enamma, heegiddeeya?) | ನೀನು (neenu) - informal "you" |

> **Thinking Point:** Kannada society places great importance on showing respect to elders and those in positions of authority. This is reflected in the language through the formal/informal distinction. When in doubt, use the formal forms to show respect.

### Common Phrases for Beginners

| English | Kannada | Transliteration |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Yes | ಹೌದು | haudu |
| No | ಇಲ್ಲ | illa |
| Please | ದಯವಿಟ್ಟು | dayaviTTu |
| Sorry | ಕ್ಷಮಿಸಿ | kshamisi |
| Excuse me | ಕ್ಷಮಿಸಿ | kshamisi |
| I don't understand | ನನಗೆ ಅರ್ಥವಾಗುತ್ತಿಲ್ಲ | nanage arthaavaaguttilla |
| I don't know Kannada well | ನನಗೆ ಕನ್ನಡ ಚೆನ್ನಾಗಿ ಬರುವುದಿಲ್ಲ | nanage kannaDa chennaagi baruvudilla |
| Please speak slowly | ದಯವಿಟ್ಟು ನಿಧಾನವಾಗಿ ಮಾತಾಡಿ | dayaviTTu nidhaanavaagi maataaDi |

### Common Mistakes

* **Using ನಮಸ್ಕಾರ (namaskara) at night:** While technically not incorrect (as it works any time), if someone specifically says ಶುಭ ರಾತ್ರಿ (shubha raatri - Good night), it's better to respond with the same.

* **Not distinguishing between formal and informal:** Using the informal ಹೇಗಿದ್ದೀಯ? (heegiddeeya?) with elders or strangers can be considered disrespectful. When in doubt, use the formal ಹೇಗಿದ್ದೀರಿ? (heegiddeeri?).

* **Using ಶುಭ ರಾತ್ರಿ (shubha raatri) as a greeting:** This is primarily used when someone is going to bed, similar to "good night" in English. It's not a typical evening greeting when meeting someone.

### Quick Practice

How would you say the following in Kannada? Consider the context!

1. Greet your teacher in the morning.
2. Ask your friend how they are.
3. Say goodbye to someone you're likely to see tomorrow.
4. Thank someone for their help.
5. Say "I don't speak Kannada well."

*(Think about formality and time of day!)*
