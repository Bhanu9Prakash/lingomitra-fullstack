## Lesson 1: Building Your First Hindi Sentences - Verbs, Pronouns & Basic Structure

Welcome! In this foundational lesson, we'll unlock the basics of forming simple Hindi sentences. We'll learn how to say *who* is doing something and how word order works differently from English. Forget rote memorization; we're focusing on patterns and English-Hindi connections to make learning intuitive.

### The Building Blocks: Who is Who? (Pronouns)

First, let's meet the words for *who* is performing the action. Pay attention to the sounds!

*(**Pronunciation Key:** Hindi vowels are generally consistent. 'a' is like the 'u' in 'cut', 'aa' is like 'a' in 'father', 'i' is like 'i' in 'bit', 'ee' is like 'ee' in 'meet', 'u' is like 'u' in 'put', 'oo' is like 'oo' in 'boot', 'e' is like 'e' in 'bed', 'ai' is like 'a' in 'cake', 'o' is like 'o' in 'go', 'au' is like 'aw' in 'saw')*

| Hindi | Transliteration | Pronunciation Hint | English | Intuitive Hint |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|---------|----------------|
| **मैं** | **main** | *mein* (like "mine") | I | This is how you refer to yourself. |
| **तू** | **tu** | *too* (informal) | You (very informal) | Only for very close friends, children, or in anger. |
| **तुम** | **tum** | *toom* | You (informal) | For friends, family, younger people. |
| **आप** | **aap** | *aap* (like "up" but longer) | You (formal) | For elders, strangers, respected people. Also means "you all". |
| **यह** | **yeh** | *yeh* (like "yeah") | He/She/This | For people/things nearby. No gender distinction in pronoun. |
| **वह** | **voh** | *voh* (like "vo") | He/She/That | For people/things at a distance. No gender distinction. |
| **हम** | **hum** | *hum* | We | Like the humming sound "hum". |
| **वे** | **ve** | *vay* | They | Formal "they". Often replaced with "voh" in spoken Hindi. |

> **Thinking Point: Formality Levels**
> Hindi distinguishes three levels of formality for "you", unlike modern English which uses one word for all situations. This reflects the importance of showing appropriate respect in Hindi culture. When in doubt, use `aap` to be respectful.

### The Key Difference: Word Order in Hindi

The most important structural difference between Hindi and English is the sentence word order:

* **English**: Subject + Verb + Object (SVO)
  * "I eat bread."

* **Hindi**: Subject + Object + Verb (SOV)
  * "I bread eat."
  * `मैं रोटी खाता हूँ।` 
  * `Main roti khata hoon.` 

This verb-last pattern is consistent throughout Hindi and is key to sounding natural. Think of keeping the action word for the end!

### The Verb "To Be" (Present Tense)

The verb "to be" (am, is, are) is essential. In Hindi, it's `होना` (hona), and its present tense forms are:

| Pronoun | Hindi | Transliteration | Pronunciation | English |
|---------|-------|----------------|--------------|---------|
| मैं (main) | **हूँ** | **hoon** | *hoon* | I am |
| तू (tu) | **है** | **hai** | *hai* (like "hi") | You are (very informal) |
| तुम (tum) | **हो** | **ho** | *ho* | You are (informal) |
| आप (aap) | **हैं** | **hain** | *hain* (like "hi" + n) | You are (formal) |
| यह/वह (yeh/voh) | **है** | **hai** | *hai* | He/She/It is |
| हम (hum) | **हैं** | **hain** | *hain* | We are |
| वे (ve) | **हैं** | **hain** | *hain* | They are |

**Examples:**
* `मैं खुश हूँ।` - `Main khush hoon.` (I am happy.)
* `तुम अच्छे हो।` - `Tum achche ho.` (You are good.) - to a friend
* `आप बहुत अच्छे हैं।` - `Aap bahut achche hain.` (You are very good.) - to an elder

> **Thinking Point:** Notice how Hindi has different forms of "to be" based on who is being described, similar to how English changes from "am" to "is" to "are".

### Your First Full Sentences

Let's combine pronouns and the verb "to be" with some useful vocabulary:

| Hindi | Transliteration | English |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| अच्छा (m) / अच्छी (f) | achcha / achchi | good |
| खुश | khush | happy |
| थका (m) / थकी (f) | thaka / thaki | tired |
| भारतीय | bharatiya | Indian |
| विद्यार्थी | vidyarthi | student |
| अध्यापक (m) / अध्यापिका (f) | adhyapak / adhyapika | teacher |

**Building Sentences:**
* `मैं विद्यार्थी हूँ।` - `Main vidyarthi hoon.` (I am a student.)
* `तुम अच्छे हो।` - `Tum achche ho.` (You are good.) - male friend
* `तुम अच्छी हो।` - `Tum achchi ho.` (You are good.) - female friend
* `वह अध्यापक है।` - `Voh adhyapak hai.` (He is a teacher.)
* `वह अध्यापिका है।` - `Voh adhyapika hai.` (She is a teacher.)
* `हम भारतीय हैं।` - `Hum bharatiya hain.` (We are Indian.)

### Building Simple Action Sentences

Now let's look at some simple action verbs in present tense:

| Hindi | Transliteration | English |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| खाना | khana | to eat |
| पीना | peena | to drink |
| जाना | jana | to go |
| आना | aana | to come |
| करना | karna | to do |
| देखना | dekhna | to see |

In present tense, Hindi verbs change their form based on who is performing the action (similar to "I eat" vs. "he eats" in English) and also based on gender of the subject in some cases.

For most verbs in present tense, add:
* `-ta hoon` (male speaker) or `-ti hoon` (female speaker) for "I"
* `-ta hai` (male) or `-ti hai` (female) for "he/she"
* `-te hain` (males or mixed) or `-ti hain` (all females) for "they/we/you(formal)"
* `-te ho` (male) or `-ti ho` (female) for "you" (informal)

**Examples:**
* `मैं खाता हूँ।` - `Main khata hoon.` (I eat.) - male speaker
* `मैं खाती हूँ।` - `Main khati hoon.` (I eat.) - female speaker
* `वह जाता है।` - `Voh jata hai.` (He goes.)
* `वह जाती है।` - `Voh jati hai.` (She goes.)
* `हम देखते हैं।` - `Hum dekhte hain.` (We see.) - group including males
* `हम देखती हैं।` - `Hum dekhti hain.` (We see.) - all-female group

### Adding Objects: Complete Sentences

Remember the word order: Subject + Object + Verb

| Hindi | Transliteration | English |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| पानी | pani | water |
| चाय | chai | tea |
| रोटी | roti | bread/flatbread |
| फल | phal | fruit |
| किताब | kitab | book |
| फिल्म | film | movie |

**Complete Sentences:**
* `मैं पानी पीता हूँ।` - `Main pani peeta hoon.` (I drink water.) - male speaker
* `वह चाय पीती है।` - `Voh chai peeti hai.` (She drinks tea.)
* `हम फिल्म देखते हैं।` - `Hum film dekhte hain.` (We watch a movie.)
* `तुम क्या करते हो?` - `Tum kya karte ho?` (What do you do?) - to male friend
* `आप कहाँ जाते हैं?` - `Aap kahan jaate hain?` (Where do you go?) - formal

### Common Mistakes & Thinking Traps

* **Word Order:** Putting the verb before the object as in English. *"मैं पीता हूँ पानी"* is incorrect. Remember: Subject + Object + Verb → `मैं पानी पीता हूँ।`
* **Forgetting Gender Agreement:** Using masculine `-ta` forms for female subjects or vice versa. A female speaker must say `मैं जाती हूँ` not `मैं जाता हूँ`.
* **Formality Confusion:** Using `तू` (tu) with people you've just met. This is considered very rude. When in doubt, use the formal `आप` (aap).
* **Verb-Pronoun Agreement:** Using the wrong form of "to be" with pronouns. Each pronoun pairs with a specific form (`मैं हूँ`, `वह है`, `हम हैं`, etc.).

### Quick Practice: Think it Through!

Translate these sentences into Hindi. Think about subject, object, verb order and gender agreement.

1. I am happy. (for a male speaker)
2. He drinks water.
3. We see a movie. (mixed group)
4. You are a teacher. (to a female, informal)
5. She goes home. (Use "ghar" for "home")
6. What are you doing? (formal)

*(Try constructing the sentences yourself before checking!)*
