## Lesson 9: Talking About the Past - The Past Tense

Now that we've covered present and future tenses, let's delve into the past tense in Hindi. Hindi has several past tense forms, but we'll focus on the most essential one: the simple past tense.

### The Simple Past Tense (सामान्य भूतकाल - Samanya Bhootkaal)

Unlike the present tense, which uses auxiliary verbs (`है`, `हो`, `हैं`), or the future tense with its special endings, the Hindi past tense forms verbs according to gender and number of both the subject and sometimes the object.

### Formation Pattern for Regular Verbs

For most verbs, the past tense is formed by:
1. Taking the verb root (removing -ना from the infinitive)
2. Adding gender/number endings:
   * Masculine singular: `-ा` (-a)
   * Feminine singular: `-ी` (-i)
   * Masculine plural: `-े` (-e)
   * Feminine plural: `-ीं` (-in)

Let's look at some examples with common verbs:

**खाना (khana - to eat)**
* Masculine singular: `खाया` (khaya) - ate
* Feminine singular: `खाई` (khai) - ate
* Masculine plural: `खाए` (khaye) - ate
* Feminine plural: `खाईं` (khain) - ate

**पीना (peena - to drink)**
* Masculine singular: `पिया` (piya) - drank
* Feminine singular: `पी` (pi) - drank 
* Masculine plural: `पिए` (piye) - drank
* Feminine plural: `पीं` (pin) - drank

**Full Conjugation in Past Tense:**

| Subject | जाना (jana - to go) | खाना (khana - to eat) |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| मैं (I - male) | गया (gaya) | खाया (khaya) |
| मैं (I - female) | गई (gayi) | खाई (khai) |
| तुम (you - inf. male) | गए (gaye) | खाए (khaye) |
| तुम (you - inf. female) | गई (gayi) | खाई (khai) |
| आप (you - formal male) | गए (gaye) | खाए (khaye) |
| आप (you - formal female) | गईं (gayin) | खाईं (khain) |
| वह (he) | गया (gaya) | खाया (khaya) |
| वह (she) | गई (gayi) | खाई (khai) |
| हम (we - all/mixed) | गए (gaye) | खाए (khaye) |
| हम (we - all females) | गईं (gayin) | खाईं (khain) |
| वे (they - all/mixed) | गए (gaye) | खाए (khaye) |
| वे (they - all females) | गईं (gayin) | खाईं (khain) |

### Using the Past Tense in Sentences

**Basic Examples:**
* `मैं कल बाज़ार गया।` - `Main kal bazaar gaya.` (I went to the market yesterday.) - male speaker
* `वह खाना खाई।` - `Voh khana khai.` (She ate food.)
* `हम सिनेमा देखने गए।` - `Hum cinema dekhne gaye.` (We went to see a movie.) - mixed or all male group
* `लड़कियाँ स्कूल गईं।` - `Larkiyan school gayin.` (The girls went to school.)

### Negative Past Tense

To form a negative past statement, simply add `नहीं` (nahin - not) before the verb:

* `मैं नहीं गया।` - `Main nahin gaya.` (I did not go.) - male speaker
* `वह नहीं आई।` - `Voh nahin aayi.` (She did not come.)
* `हम वहाँ नहीं गए।` - `Hum vahan nahin gaye.` (We did not go there.)

### Irregular Past Forms

Some verbs have irregular past tense forms:

**होना (hona - to be):**
* Masculine singular: `था` (tha) - was
* Feminine singular: `थी` (thi) - was
* Masculine plural: `थे` (the) - were
* Feminine plural: `थीं` (theen) - were

**Examples:**
* `मैं वहाँ था।` - `Main vahan tha.` (I was there.) - male speaker
* `वह बीमार थी।` - `Voh bimaar thi.` (She was sick.)
* `हम सब खुश थे।` - `Hum sab khush the.` (We all were happy.) - mixed or all male group

**करना (karna - to do):**
* Masculine singular: `किया` (kiya) - did
* Feminine singular: `की` (ki) - did
* Masculine plural: `किए` (kiye) - did
* Feminine plural: `कीं` (keen) - did

**देना (dena - to give):**
* Masculine singular: `दिया` (diya) - gave
* Feminine singular: `दी` (di) - gave
* Masculine plural: `दिए` (diye) - gave
* Feminine plural: `दीं` (deen) - gave

**लेना (lena - to take):**
* Masculine singular: `लिया` (liya) - took
* Feminine singular: `ली` (li) - took
* Masculine plural: `लिए` (liye) - took
* Feminine plural: `लीं` (leen) - took

### Compound Verbs in the Past Tense

Hindi often uses compound verbs to express completed actions. These combine a main verb with an auxiliary verb (often जाना, लेना, देना) to add subtle shades of meaning:

**Examples:**
* `वह चला गया।` - `Voh chala gaya.` (He went away.) - More definitive than just `वह चला`
* `मैंने खाना खा लिया।` - `Maine khana kha liya.` (I have eaten the food.) - Completed action
* `उसने किताब पढ़ डाली।` - `Usne kitab parh daali.` (She read the book completely.)

### Transitive Verbs and the Ergative Case

A special feature of Hindi past tense is that with transitive verbs (verbs that take direct objects), the subject is often marked with `ने` (ne), changing to what's called the ergative case:

**Structure (for transitive verbs in past tense):**
**Subject + ने + Object + Verb**

In this construction, the verb agrees with the object (not the subject) in gender and number:

**Examples:**
* `राम ने खाना खाया।` - `Ram ne khana khaya.` (Ram ate food.) - `खाना` (food) is masculine, so verb is `खाया` (khaya)
* `राम ने रोटी खाई।` - `Ram ne roti khai.` (Ram ate bread.) - `रोटी` (bread) is feminine, so verb is `खाई` (khai)
* `लड़कों ने किताबें पढ़ीं।` - `Larkon ne kitabein parhin.` (The boys read books.) - `किताबें` (books) is feminine plural, so verb is `पढ़ीं` (parhin)

**Pronouns in Ergative Case:**

| Pronoun | With ने | Transliteration |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| मैं (I) | मैंने | maine |
| तू (you - v. inf.) | तूने | tune |
| तुम (you - inf.) | तुमने | tumne |
| आप (you - formal) | आपने | aapne |
| वह (he/she) | उसने | usne |
| हम (we) | हमने | hamne |
| वे (they) | उन्होंने | unhonne |

**Examples:**
* `मैंने खाना खाया।` - `Maine khana khaya.` (I ate food.)
* `तुमने क्या देखा?` - `Tumne kya dekha?` (What did you see?)
* `उसने मुझे बुलाया।` - `Usne mujhe bulaya.` (He/She called me.)
* `हमने फिल्म देखी।` - `Hamne film dekhi.` (We watched a movie.)

> **Thinking Point:** The ergative construction might seem strange to English speakers, but it's similar to how we might say "It was eaten by me" where the focus shifts to the object. In Hindi, this is a standard way to talk about completed actions with direct objects.

### Intransitive vs. Transitive Verbs

It's important to understand which verbs are intransitive (don't take objects) versus transitive (take direct objects):

**Intransitive Verbs (no ने):**
* `जाना` (jana - to go)
* `आना` (aana - to come)
* `बैठना` (baithna - to sit)
* `सोना` (sona - to sleep)
* `रोना` (rona - to cry)

**Transitive Verbs (use ने):**
* `खाना` (khana - to eat)
* `पीना` (peena - to drink)
* `देखना` (dekhna - to see)
* `लिखना` (likhna - to write)
* `पढ़ना` (parhna - to read)

### Common Mistakes

* **Forgetting Gender Agreement:** Using masculine verb forms with feminine subjects or objects (based on whether the verb is transitive or intransitive).
* **Incorrect Ergative Usage:** Not using `ने` (ne) with transitive verbs or using it with intransitive verbs.
* **Agreement Confusion:** Having the verb agree with the subject in transitive sentences when it should agree with the object.
* **Pronoun Forms:** Using basic pronouns instead of their ergative forms (e.g., `मैं` instead of `मैंने`).
* **Verb Stem Issues:** Incorrect transformations from verb infinitives to past forms, especially with irregular verbs.

### Quick Practice

Translate these sentences into Hindi. Pay attention to transitivity, gender, and number agreement.

1. I went to the market. (male speaker)
2. She ate an apple. (Use: सेब - seb - apple, masculine)
3. We read a book. (mixed group - Use: किताब - kitab - book, feminine)
4. The girls were happy. (Use: खुश - khush - happy)
5. He didn't sleep last night. (Use: कल रात - kal raat - last night)
6. Did you drink tea? (to female friend - Use: चाय - chai - tea, feminine)

*(Focus on using the correct past tense forms with appropriate gender and number agreement!)*
