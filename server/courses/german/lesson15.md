## Lesson 15: Where's the '-ing'? Expressing Ongoing Actions

You might have noticed something interesting by now: German doesn't really have direct grammatical equivalents for English continuous tenses like "I **am reading**," "He **was playing**," or "We **will be travelling**." There's no standard "sein + verb-ing" structure.

So, how does German express actions that are ongoing or in progress? It's simpler than you might think! German relies heavily on **context** and occasionally **adverbs** to convey this meaning, primarily using its simple tense forms. This often makes the grammar structure *less* complicated than English in this specific area.

### Present Ongoing Actions (English Present Continuous)

To express an action happening *right now*, German simply uses the **Simple Present Tense (Präsens)**.

| English Sentence                      | German Equivalent (Simple Present) | Thinking Point                                        |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| I read. / I **am reading**.           | Ich **lese**.                      | One German form covers both English ideas.            |
| He plays. / He **is playing**.        | Er **spielt**.                     | Context tells you if it's habitual or happening now. |
| We learn. / We **are learning**.      | Wir **lernen**.                    | Simple Present is flexible.                           |
| What do you do? / What **are** you **doing**? | Was **machst** du?                 | The simple question form covers the ongoing action. |

**How to Emphasize "Right Now":** If you really need to stress that something is happening *at this very moment*, you can add adverbs like:

*   **gerade** (*guh-rah-duh*) - right now, just now
*   **jetzt** (*yetst*) - now
*   **im Moment** (*im Moh-ment*) - at the moment

*   `Was machst du **gerade**?` (What are you doing **right now**?)
*   `Ich lese **gerade** ein Buch.` (I **am reading** a book **right now**.)
*   `Er spielt **jetzt** Fußball.` (He **is playing** football **now**.)

> **Language Transfer Intuition:** Instead of changing the verb form (like adding "-ing"), German often just adds a time word if clarification is absolutely needed. Often, the context makes it clear enough without any extra words.

### Past Ongoing Actions (English Past Continuous)

Similarly, German uses its standard past tenses – the **Simple Past (Präteritum)** or the **Present Perfect (Perfekt)** – where English might use the Past Continuous ("was/were + verb-ing").

| English Sentence                        | German Equivalent (Präteritum/Perfekt) | Thinking Point                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| I read. / I **was reading**. / I have read. | Ich **las**. (Präteritum) / Ich **habe gelesen**. (Perfekt) | Context (like another past action happening) clarifies the ongoing nature. |
| He played. / He **was playing**. / He has played. | Er **spielte**. (Präteritum) / Er **hat gespielt**. (Perfekt) | The same past forms are used.                                                  |

**Clarifying Overlapping Actions:** Context, especially using conjunctions like `als` (when - for a specific point in the past) or `während` (while/during), shows an action was ongoing when something else happened.

*   `Ich **las** / **habe gelesen**, als du anriefst.` (I **was reading** when you called.)
*   `Er **spielte** / **hat gespielt**, während ich kochte.` (He **was playing** while I cooked.)

### Future Ongoing Actions (English Future Continuous)

You guessed it – German typically uses the **Simple Future (werden + Infinitiv)** or even just the **Simple Present + a future time marker**.

| English Sentence                          | German Equivalent (Future/Present)     | Thinking Point                                    |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| I will read. / I **will be reading**.     | Ich **werde lesen**. / Ich **lese**... | The simple future covers the ongoing idea.      |
| He will play. / He **will be playing**.   | Er **wird spielen**. / Er **spielt**...| Context (like "tomorrow at this time") implies duration. |

**Clarifying Future Duration:** Use specific time phrases.

*   `Morgen um diese Zeit **werde ich arbeiten**.` (Tomorrow at this time, I **will be working**.)
*   `Nächste Woche **sind wir unterwegs**.` (Next week, we **will be traveling / are on the way**.)

### Summary: No "-ing" Form Needed!

German manages perfectly well without a dedicated continuous tense structure. It uses its standard simple tenses, and relies on:
1.  **Context:** The situation usually makes it clear if an action is habitual or ongoing.
2.  **Adverbs:** Words like `gerade`, `jetzt`, or specific time phrases can be added for emphasis.
3.  **Conjunctions:** Words like `als` or `während` show overlapping past actions.

This is often a relief for learners, as it's one less complex verb form to worry about compared to English!

### Common Mistakes

*   **Trying to Force an "-ing":** Creating non-existent forms like *"Ich bin lesend"* as a direct translation of "I am reading". While `lesend` (reading) exists as a participle (adjective/adverb), it's *not* used to form a standard continuous tense.
*   **Overusing `gerade`:** Feeling the need to add `gerade` constantly. Use it only when you specifically need to contrast an ongoing action with a habitual one or when context is unclear.
*   **Thinking German Can't Express Ongoing Actions:** Just because the *grammatical form* is missing doesn't mean the *meaning* can't be expressed. Context does the heavy lifting.

### Quick Practice

How would you express the *meaning* of these English sentences in standard German? Focus on using the simple tenses correctly. Add `gerade` only if you feel it's truly necessary for clarity.

1.  She is writing an email (right now).
2.  What were you (informal, sing.) doing when I called (`als ich anrief`)?
3.  We are travelling to Austria next week (`nächste Woche`).
4.  Look! It is raining. (`Schau mal! Es regnet.`) - *How does German handle this?*
5.  I was working while he was sleeping (`während er schlief`).

*(Think about which simple tense fits best and whether context is enough.)*

***Practice Answers:***

1.  *Sie schreibt (gerade) eine E-Mail.* (Simple Present; `gerade` optional but common here).
2.  *Was hast du gemacht, als ich anrief?* (Perfekt is common for past questions in speech) or *Was machtest du, als ich anrief?* (Präteritum).
3.  *Wir reisen nächste Woche nach Österreich.* (Simple Present + future time) or *Wir werden nächste Woche nach Österreich reisen.* (Simple Future).
4.  *Schau mal! Es regnet.* (Simple Present is perfectly natural here).
5.  *Ich habe gearbeitet / arbeitete, während er schlief.* (Perfekt or Präteritum for the first clause).
