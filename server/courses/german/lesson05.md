## Lesson 5: Saying Hello & Goodbye - German Greetings (Grüße)

Greetings are your entry point into any conversation! German has different greetings depending on the time of day and how well you know the person. Let's learn the most common ones.

### Basic Hellos

These are versatile ways to greet someone.

| English | German     | Pronunciation Hint | Intuitive Usage Note                                      |
|---------|------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Hello   | **Hallo**  | *Hal-loh*          | The most common, all-purpose greeting. Safe in most situations, slightly informal but widely accepted. |
| Hi      | **Hi**     | *Hai*              | Very informal, just like English "Hi". Use with friends, peers, younger people. |
| Hey     | **Hey**    | *Hey*              | Very informal, similar to English "Hey". Use with close friends. |

### Greetings Based on Time of Day

These are very common and show a bit more politeness, especially in more formal settings.

| English         | German            | Pronunciation Hint              | Literal Meaning & Usage Note                                     |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Good morning    | **Guten Morgen**  | *Goo-ten Mor-gen*               | "Good Morning". Use until about 10-11 AM.                        |
| Good day        | **Guten Tag**     | *Goo-ten Tahk* (hard 'g' at end)| "Good Day". The standard polite greeting from mid-morning until evening (approx. 11 AM - 6 PM). Very common. |
| Good evening    | **Guten Abend**   | *Goo-ten Ah-bent*               | "Good Evening". Use in the evening, typically after 6 PM.          |
| Good night      | **Gute Nacht**    | *Goo-tuh Nakht* (hard 'ch')     | "Good Night". Used only when someone is going to bed/sleep. It's a farewell, not a greeting when arriving somewhere at night. |

> **Thinking Point: 'Guten' vs. 'Gute'**
> Notice how "Morgen", "Tag", and "Abend" use **`Guten`**, while "Nacht" uses **`Gute`**? This is a sneak peek into German grammar called *cases* and *gender*. Don't worry about the rules now, just remember:
> *   `Guten` for Morgen, Tag, Abend.
> *   `Gute` for Nacht.
> It's similar to how English used to have more variations but simplified over time.

### Formal vs. Informal Greetings: A Quick Summary

Knowing when to be formal or informal is important in German culture.

| Situation                             | Greeting Examples                 | Farewell Examples (see below) | Pronoun to Use |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| **Formal** (Strangers, officials, older people, business, shops) | Guten Tag, Guten Morgen, Guten Abend | Auf Wiedersehen             | **Sie** (You, formal) |
| **Informal** (Friends, family, children, close colleagues, peers) | Hallo, Hi, Hey, Morgen\*, Tag\*      | Tschüss, Ciao                 | **du** (you, sing.) / **ihr** (you, pl.) |

> **\*Informal Shortcuts:** Friends often shorten `Guten Morgen` to just **`Morgen!`** or `Guten Tag` to **`Tag!`**. These are definitely informal.

### Saying Goodbye (Abschied)

Just like greetings, farewells vary by formality.

| English                     | German             | Pronunciation Hint               | Formality & Usage Note                                        |
|-----------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Goodbye (formal)            | **Auf Wiedersehen**| *Owf Vee-der-zay-en*             | "Until we see again". Standard polite farewell. Use with `Sie`. |
| Goodbye (on the phone)      | **Auf Wiederhören**| *Owf Vee-der-hoer-en* (`ö` sound)| "Until we hear again". Used *only* when ending a phone call. |
| Goodbye (informal)          | **Tschüss**        | *Chewss* (`ü` sound)             | Very common, slightly informal but widely used. Safe default if unsure but leaning informal. |
| Bye (very informal)         | **Ciao**           | *Chow* (like Italian)            | Borrowed from Italian, very informal. Use with friends.       |
| See you later!              | **Bis später!**    | *Biss Shpay-ter*                 | "Until later!". Informal.                                   |
| See you soon!               | **Bis bald!**      | *Biss Balt*                      | "Until soon!". Informal.                                    |
| See you tomorrow!           | **Bis morgen!**    | *Biss Mor-gen*                   | "Until tomorrow!". Can be formal or informal.               |

> **Thinking Point: 'Auf Wiedersehen'**
> This literally breaks down to `Auf` (On/Again), `Wieder` (Again), `Sehen` (To see). It highlights the German tendency to build precise words from components. `Auf Wiederhören` swaps `sehen` (see) for `hören` (hear).

### Asking "How Are You?"

| English                         | German                       | Pronunciation Hint    | Formality & Usage                                                              |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| How are you? (Formal)           | **Wie geht es Ihnen?**       | *Vee gayt ess Ee-nen?*| Standard polite way. Use with `Sie`. Often shortened to **Wie geht's Ihnen?** |
| How are you? (Informal, sing.)| **Wie geht es dir?**         | *Vee gayt ess deer?*  | Use with one person you know well (`du`). Often shortened to **Wie geht's dir?** or just **Wie geht's?** (*Vee gayts?*) |
| How are you? (Informal, pl.)  | **Wie geht es euch?**        | *Vee gayt ess oysh?* (`eu`=oy, `ch` soft) | Use with a group you know well (`ihr`). Often shortened to **Wie geht's euch?** |

> **Responding:** A simple common answer is **`Gut, danke.`** (*Goot, dan-kuh*) - "Good, thank you." You can add **`Und Ihnen?`** (Formal) or **`Und dir?`** (Informal) - "And you?".

### Common Mistakes

*   **Using `Gute Nacht` as a greeting:** Saying `Gute Nacht` when arriving somewhere late in the evening. It's strictly a "going to bed" farewell. Use `Guten Abend` instead.
*   **Using `Tschüss` or `Hi` in very formal situations:** While `Hallo` is quite flexible, `Hi` and `Tschüss` can be seen as too informal for initial encounters with officials, elderly strangers, or high-level business contacts. Stick to `Guten Tag` and `Auf Wiedersehen` when unsure.
*   **Using `Auf Wiedersehen` on the phone:** Remember the specific phone farewell is `Auf Wiederhören`.
*   **Mixing up `Ihnen` (formal You) and `dir`/`euch` (informal You):** Asking a stranger *"Wie geht's dir?"* is too informal. Use *"Wie geht es Ihnen?"*.

### Quick Practice

How would you say the following in German? Consider the context!

1.  Greet your teacher in the morning.
2.  Say "Hi" to a friend.
3.  Say goodbye politely to a shopkeeper.
4.  Say goodbye casually to your friends as you leave a café.
5.  Ask your boss (formal) how they are.
6.  End a phone call politely.

*(Think about formality and time of day!)*
