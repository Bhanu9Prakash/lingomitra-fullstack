## Lesson 1: Building Your First German Sentences - Verbs, Pronouns & Pronunciation

Welcome! In this foundational lesson, we'll unlock the basics of forming simple German sentences. We'll learn how to say *who* is doing something and how the *action word* (verb) changes. Plus, we'll get comfortable with some essential German sounds. Forget rote memorization; we're focusing on patterns and connections to English.

### The Building Blocks: Who is Who? (Pronouns)

First, let's meet the words for *who* is performing the action. Pay attention to the sounds!

*(**Pronunciation Key:** We'll use simple English approximations. 'ch' can be tricky - sometimes like the 'ch' in Scottish 'loch', sometimes softer like 'h' in 'huge'. 'ie' is like 'ee' in 'see'. 'ei' is like 'eye'. 'eu' is like 'oy' in 'toy'. Umlauts: ä ≈ 'eh', ö ≈ 'er' (like in 'hurt', but with rounded lips), ü ≈ 'ew' (like in 'few', but with rounded lips). 'ß' is just a sharp 's'. 'z' is like 'ts'.)*

| German     | Pronunciation Hint        | English                  | Intuitive Hint                                           |
|------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **ich**    | *ish*                     | I                        | Unique sound, central to speaking about yourself.        |
| **du**     | *doo*                     | You (informal, singular) | Use with one friend, family member, child.               |
| **er**     | *air*                     | He                       | Like English 'air'.                                       |
| **sie**    | *zee*                     | She                      | Like 'zee' or 'see'. Context tells you if it's 'she'.      |
| **es**     | *ess*                     | It                       | Like the English letter 's'.                              |
| **wir**    | *veer*                    | We                       | Sounds close to English 'we're'.                           |
| **ihr**    | *ear*                     | You (informal, plural)   | Like English 'ear'. Use when talking *to* 2+ friends/family. |
| **sie**    | *zee*                     | they                     | Same sound as 'she'! Context is key.                     |
| **Sie**    | *Zee* (always capitalized)| You (formal, sing./pl.)  | Same sound again! Use for strangers, officials, in shops. |

> **Thinking Point: The Many "Yous"**
> Unlike modern English, German distinguishes:
> *   `du`: one person you know well.
> *   `ihr`: multiple people you know well.
> *   `Sie`: one or more people you address formally/politely (always capitalized!).
> This politeness distinction is important in German culture. When in doubt, use `Sie`.

### The Action Words: Verbs & Their Endings

Most basic German verbs in their dictionary form (the *infinitive*) end with **-en**. Think of this like "to..." in English (e.g., "to go", "to see").

Examples:
*   **lernen** (*lair-nen*) = to learn
*   **machen** (*makh-en* - 'ch' like in Scottish 'loch') = to do / to make
*   **spielen** (*shpee-len*) = to play *(Note: 'sp' at the start of a word often sounds like 'shp')*

To use a verb in a sentence, we typically do two things:
1.  Find the **verb root** (or **stem**): Remove the **-en** ending.
    *   `lernen` -> `lern`
    *   `machen` -> `mach`
    *   `spielen` -> `spiel`
2.  Add a specific **ending** based on *who* (the pronoun) is doing the action.

**Let's see this with `lernen` (to learn) - Root: `lern`**

This pattern works for MOST regular verbs:

| Pronoun    | Root | Ending | Full Verb      | Pronunciation | How to Think About It                                  |
|------------|------|--------|----------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| ich        | lern | **-e** | lern**e**      | *lair-nuh*    | `ich` usually takes an `-e`. Simple and common.        |
| du         | lern | **-st**| lern**st**     | *lairnst*     | `du` almost always adds `-st`.                           |
| er/sie/es  | lern | **-t** | lern**t**      | *lairnt*      | `er/sie/es` usually takes `-t`.                          |
| wir        | lern | **-en**| lern**en**     | *lair-nen*    | `wir` uses the full infinitive `-en` form. Easy!        |
| ihr        | lern | **-t** | lern**t**      | *lairnt*      | `ihr` takes `-t`, just like `er/sie/es`.                 |
| sie/Sie    | lern | **-en**| lern**en**     | *lair-nen*    | `sie/Sie` also use the full infinitive `-en`. Convenient! |

> **Spot the Pattern!** `-e`, `-st`, `-t`, `-en`, `-t`, `-en`. The `wir` and `sie/Sie` forms often match the dictionary form, which is a great shortcut!

> **A Quick Note on "Irregular" Verbs:** Some verbs in the list above (like `sprechen`, `essen`, `sehen`, `lesen`, `fahren`, `laufen`, `schlafen`, `treffen`) have a small vowel change in their **root** but *only* for the `du` and `er/sie/es` forms. For example, `lesen` (to read) becomes `du l**ie**st` and `er l**ie**st`. Don't worry about mastering these changes right now! Just be aware they exist. For today, focus on applying the standard endings (`-e`, `-st`, `-t`, `-en`, `-t`, `-en`) to the roots listed. We'll tackle the vowel changes very soon in another lesson.

### Building Simple Sentences: Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)

Great news! Basic German sentence structure is often the same as English:

**Subject (Who) - Verb (Action, conjugated) - Object (What/Whom)**

Let's try making sentences with our new verbs and pronouns. Remember to match the verb ending to the subject!

*   **Wir essen Pizza.** (*Veer essen Pizza.*)
    *   Subject: `Wir` (We)
    *   Verb: `essen` (Matches `wir` - uses the `-en` infinitive form)
    *   Object: `Pizza` (*Peet-za*) (Pizza)
    *   Meaning: We eat Pizza.

*   **Ich lerne Deutsch.** (*Ish lair-nuh Doytch.*)
    *   Subject: `Ich` (I)
    *   Verb: `lerne` (Root `lern` + `-e` for `ich`)
    *   Object: `Deutsch` (*Doytch*) (German language)
    *   Meaning: I learn German.

*   **Du spielst Kricket.** (*Doo shpeelst Kricket.*)
    *   Subject: `Du` (You, informal sing.)
    *   Verb: `spielst` (Root `spiel` + `-st` for `du`)
    *   Object: `Kricket` (*Kricket*) (Cricket)
    *   Meaning: You play Cricket.

*   **Er wohnt in Berlin.** (*Air vohnt in Bair-leen.*)
    *   Subject: `Er` (He)
    *   Verb: `wohnt` (Root `wohn` + `-t` for `er`)
    *   Object/Place: `in Berlin` (*in Bair-leen*) (in Berlin)
    *   Meaning: He lives in Berlin.

*   **Sie (formal) hören Musik.** (*Zee hoer-en Moo-zeek.*)
    *   Subject: `Sie` (You, formal)
    *   Verb: `hören` (Matches `Sie` - uses the `-en` infinitive form)
    *   Object: `Musik` (*Moo-zeek*) (Music)
    *   Meaning: You (formal) listen to music.

*   **Ihr tanzt gut.** (*Ear tantst goot.*)
    *   Subject: `Ihr` (You, informal pl.)
    *   Verb: `tanzt` (Root `tanz` + `-t` for `ihr`)
    *   Adverb: `gut` (*goot*) (well)
    *   Meaning: You all dance well.

### Common Mistakes & Thinking Traps

*   **Forgetting Verb Endings:** Saying `Ich lerne**n** Deutsch` instead of `Ich lern**e** Deutsch`. **Think:** The verb *must* agree with the person doing it, just like saying "he walk**s**" not "he walk".
*   **Mixing up `sie` (she) and `sie` (they) / `Sie` (You formal):** They sound the same but use different verb endings in some cases (though not with the `-en` verbs here). The capitalization of `Sie` (formal You) is your main clue in writing. **Think:** Context and capitalization are key.
*   **Using the wrong "You":** Using `du` with a stranger or `ihr` when talking to just one friend. **Think:** `du`=buddy, `ihr`=buddies, `Sie`=Sir/Ma'am.
*   **Pronunciation Pitfalls:** Saying `Ich` like "Itch" (it's softer, *ish*). Pronouncing `w` like English 'w' (it's like English 'v'). Pronouncing `z` like English 'z' (it's 'ts'). **Think:** Train your ear and mouth for these new sounds. Listen carefully to examples.
*   **(Later trap):** Forgetting the vowel changes in irregular verbs for `du` and `er/sie/es` (like `lesen -> liest`). **Think:** We'll practice this specifically later. For now, focus on the standard endings.

### Quick Practice: Think it Through!

Translate these sentences into German. Focus on choosing the right pronoun, finding the verb root, adding the correct ending, and keeping the SVO order. Use the vocabulary list and pronunciation hints.

1.  We live in Hamburg. (Use "in Hamburg" - *in Ham-boorg*)
2.  She asks a question. (Use "eine Frage" - *eye-nuh Fraa-guh* - for "a question")
3.  You (informal, singular) bring the book. (Use "das Buch" - *dass Bookh* - for "the book")
4.  I write an email. (Use "eine E-Mail" - *eye-nuh Ee-mail* - for "an email")
5.  You (formal) sing well. (Use "gut" - *goot* - for "well")
6.  They search for the key. (Use "den Schlüssel" - *dayn Shlue-ssel* - for "the key")

*(Pause and try to construct the sentences yourself before checking!)*

***Practice Answers:***

1.  *Wir wohnen in Hamburg.*
2.  *Sie fragt eine Frage.*
3.  *Du bringst das Buch.*
4.  *Ich schreibe eine E-Mail.*
5.  *Sie singen gut.*
6.  *sie suchen den Schlüssel.*

Great job working through this foundational lesson! You've learned the core pronouns, the basic system of verb conjugation for regular verbs, sentence structure, and met 30 essential action words. Keep practicing these patterns, and you'll be building more complex sentences soon!
