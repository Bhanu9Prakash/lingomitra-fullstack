## Lesson 2: Sounds of Japanese - Pronunciation & Basic Writing System

Now that you know how to build basic sentences, let's focus on how Japanese *sounds*. Japanese pronunciation is quite straightforward once you learn the patterns. Many sounds are similar to English, and Japanese has a much more limited sound inventory, making it easier to master.

### The Japanese Sound System: Limited, Consistent, Friendly

Japanese has a relatively simple sound system compared to many languages:
- 5 vowel sounds
- About 100 basic syllables, mostly consonant+vowel combinations
- Regular stress (generally flat, with slight pitch variations)
- Very few consonant clusters

This makes pronunciation relatively accessible for English speakers!

### The 5 Vowel Sounds - The Foundation

Japanese has just 5 pure vowel sounds that stay consistent. Unlike English vowels that can change pronunciation in different words, Japanese vowels are always pronounced the same way.

| Vowel | Pronunciation         | Similar to English         | Example Word                           |
|-------|----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **a** | *ah*                 | "a" in "father"            | ありがとう (*arigatou* - thank you)        |
| **i** | *ee*                 | "ee" in "see"              | いいえ (*iie* - no)                      |
| **u** | *oo*                 | "oo" in "boot" (but shorter)| うみ (*umi* - sea)                      |
| **e** | *eh*                 | "e" in "pet"               | えき (*eki* - station)                   |
| **o** | *oh*                 | "o" in "go"                | おはよう (*ohayou* - good morning)        |

> **Thinking Point**: Japanese vowels are "pure" - they don't glide into other sounds like English diphthongs (compare "day" [dei] with Japanese "e" [e]). Keep them short, clean, and distinct.

### Consonant + Vowel Structure: The Building Blocks

Most Japanese sounds are consonant+vowel pairs. These form the basis of the Japanese syllabary called **hiragana**, which we'll introduce later.

Here's how consonants combine with vowels:

| Consonant | +a  | +i  | +u  | +e  | +o  | Notes                                   |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|------------------------------------------|
| k         | か *ka* | き *ki* | く *ku* | け *ke* | こ *ko* |                                          |
| s         | さ *sa* | し *shi* | す *su* | せ *se* | そ *so* | Note 'shi' instead of 'si'              |
| t         | た *ta* | ち *chi* | つ *tsu* | て *te* | と *to* | Note 'chi' and 'tsu' instead of 'ti','tu'|
| n         | な *na* | に *ni* | ぬ *nu* | ね *ne* | の *no* |                                          |
| h         | は *ha* | ひ *hi* | ふ *fu* | へ *he* | ほ *ho* | Note 'fu' instead of 'hu'               |
| m         | ま *ma* | み *mi* | む *mu* | め *me* | も *mo* |                                          |
| y         | や *ya* |     | ゆ *yu* |     | よ *yo* | No yi or ye sounds                       |
| r         | ら *ra* | り *ri* | る *ru* | れ *re* | ろ *ro* | Closer to English 'l' than 'r'          |
| w         | わ *wa* |     |     |     | を *wo* | Only two sounds remain in modern Japanese|
| n (alone) | ん *n*  |     |     |     |     | The only consonant that can stand alone |

There are also voiced consonants (g, z, d, b) and combinations that we'll cover as needed in later lessons.

### Key Pronunciation Points

**1. The Japanese 'R'**: This sound is a light tap of the tongue, halfway between an English 'r' and 'l':
   * ら (ra), り (ri), る (ru), れ (re), ろ (ro)
   * Not a hard American 'r' or a rolling Spanish 'r'

**2. Long vs. Short Vowels**: Vowel length can change meaning:
   * おばさん (*obasan* - aunt) vs. おばあさん (*obaasan* - grandmother)
   * Long vowels are written with double vowels or vowel+う: ああ, おう (both pronounced as a long "o")

**3. Double Consonants**: Indicated by a small 'tsu' (っ) which creates a brief pause:
   * いった (*itta* - went) vs. いた (*ita* - was)
   * Similar to the pause in English "book-keeper" (not "bookeeper")

**4. Pitch Accent**: Japanese doesn't have stress like English, but it does have subtle pitch patterns. For beginners, it's fine to speak with relatively flat intonation, adding slight emphasis to the first syllable of words.

### The Writing Systems: An Overview

Japanese uses three writing systems, but for now, we'll focus on getting comfortable with the sounds. Here's a brief explanation of what you'll encounter:

**1. Hiragana (ひらがな)**: The basic phonetic alphabet used for native Japanese words and grammar elements.
   * 46 basic characters representing syllables
   * Example: あ (a), か (ka), さ (sa)...

**2. Katakana (カタカナ)**: Used primarily for foreign loanwords, emphasis, and scientific terms.
   * 46 characters with the same sounds as hiragana
   * Example: ア (a), カ (ka), サ (sa)...

**3. Kanji (漢字)**: Chinese characters adopted into Japanese, representing concepts.
   * Thousands of characters
   * Example: 水 (water), 山 (mountain), 人 (person)

> **Comfort Note**: Throughout this course, we'll always provide the romanized pronunciation (called *romaji*) alongside any Japanese text, so you can focus on speaking without having to master the writing systems first.

### Common Pronunciation Challenges for English Speakers

**1. Vowel Length**: Keeping vowels pure and distinguishing between short and long vowels.
   * Practice: おじさん (*ojisan* - uncle) vs. おじいさん (*ojiisan* - grandfather)

**2. The 'R/L' Sound**: Finding the right tongue position for Japanese 'r'.
   * Practice: らりるれろ (*ra-ri-ru-re-ro*)

**3. Syllable-Timed Rhythm**: Giving equal timing to each syllable rather than stressing certain syllables.
   * Practice: わたしはがくせいです (*wa-ta-shi-wa-ga-ku-se-i-de-su* - I am a student)

**4. Double Consonants**: Making a distinct pause for double consonants.
   * Practice: きって (*kitte* - stamp) vs. きて (*kite* - come)

### Quick Practice: Sound Check!

Try pronouncing these common Japanese phrases, focusing on clear sounds:

1. こんにちは (*konnichiwa* - hello)
2. ありがとうございます (*arigatou gozaimasu* - thank you very much)
3. はじめまして (*hajimemashite* - pleased to meet you)
4. わかりました (*wakarimashita* - I understood)
5. おやすみなさい (*oyasuminasai* - good night)

*(Try saying these aloud a few times, focusing on clear vowels and equal timing for each syllable.)*

Mastering Japanese pronunciation early will make everything else easier. Remember that consistency is the key - Japanese sounds stay the same across all words, making it one of the more predictable pronunciation systems once you've mastered the basics.
