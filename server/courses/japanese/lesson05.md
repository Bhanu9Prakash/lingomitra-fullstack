## Lesson 5: Introducing Yourself & Basic Greetings

In this lesson, we'll learn how to introduce yourself and use common greetings in Japanese. These are foundational social skills that will get you started with basic conversations.

### Essential Japanese Greetings

Japanese has specific greetings for different times of day and situations. Unlike in English where "hello" works for most situations, Japanese uses context-specific greetings.

| Situation                  | Japanese Greeting     | Pronunciation           | Literal Meaning          |
|----------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| General greeting (formal)  | こんにちは            | *Konnichiwa*           | "This day"               |
| Morning greeting           | おはようございます    | *Ohayou gozaimasu*     | "It's early" (honorific) |
| Evening greeting           | こんばんは            | *Konbanwa*             | "This evening"           |
| When meeting someone new   | はじめまして          | *Hajimemashite*        | "For the first time"     |
| Goodbye (general)          | さようなら            | *Sayounara*            | "If that's the way it is"|
| See you later (casual)     | じゃあね              | *Jaa ne*               | "Well then, see you"     |
| See you tomorrow           | また明日              | *Mata ashita*          | "Again tomorrow"         |
| Good night                 | おやすみなさい        | *Oyasuminasai*         | "Please rest" (honorific)|
| Thank you                  | ありがとうございます  | *Arigatou gozaimasu*   | "It's difficult" (evolved meaning) |
| You're welcome             | どういたしまして      | *Dou itashimashite*    | "How [I] have done [something humble]" |
| Excuse me / I'm sorry      | すみません            | *Sumimasen*            | "It's not finished"      |

> **Cultural Note**: The casual morning greeting おはよう (*ohayou*) without ございます (*gozaimasu*) is only appropriate for family, close friends, or people younger/lower in social hierarchy. Using the full おはようございます is more polite and appropriate in most situations.

### Introducing Yourself: Basic Structure

A formal self-introduction (自己紹介 *jikoshoukai*) typically follows this structure:

1. Greeting: はじめまして (*Hajimemashite* - "Nice to meet you")
2. Name: 私は [Name] です (*Watashi wa [Name] desu* - "I am [Name]")
3. Optional: Additional information (country, occupation, etc.)
4. Closing: よろしくお願いします (*Yoroshiku onegaishimasu* - "Please be kind to me/Please treat me well")

**Complete Example:**
* はじめまして。私はマイクです。アメリカから来ました。学生です。よろしくお願いします。
* *Hajimemashite. Watashi wa Maiku desu. Amerika kara kimashita. Gakusei desu. Yoroshiku onegaishimasu.*
* "Nice to meet you. I am Mike. I came from America. I am a student. Please be kind to me."

### Key Phrases for Self-Introduction

| Purpose             | Japanese                      | Pronunciation                  | English Meaning                    |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Stating name        | 私は[Name]です                | *Watashi wa [Name] desu*      | "I am [Name]"                     |
| Stating country     | [Country]から来ました        | *[Country] kara kimashita*    | "I came from [Country]"           |
| Stating occupation  | [Occupation]です             | *[Occupation] desu*           | "I am a [Occupation]"             |
| Stating age         | [Number]歳です                | *[Number] sai desu*           | "I am [Number] years old"         |
| Stating language    | [Language]を話します         | *[Language] o hanashimasu*    | "I speak [Language]"              |
| Asking someone's name| お名前は何ですか              | *Onamae wa nan desu ka*       | "What is your name?"              |
| Where are you from? | どこから来ましたか            | *Doko kara kimashita ka*      | "Where did you come from?"        |

> **Cultural Note**: よろしくお願いします (*yoroshiku onegaishimasu*) is an essential phrase that has no direct English equivalent. It's used when meeting someone for the first time, starting a new relationship, or requesting assistance. It conveys "I look forward to our relationship" or "Please treat me well."

### First-Person Pronouns: Different Levels of Formality

Japanese has multiple first-person pronouns with varying levels of formality:

* 私 (*watashi*) - Standard, generally polite for all genders
* 私 (*watakushi*) - Very formal version of "I"
* 僕 (*boku*) - Casual, mainly used by males
* 俺 (*ore*) - Very casual/rough, used by males with close friends
* あたし (*atashi*) - Casual, mainly used by females

For beginners, using 私 (*watashi*) is appropriate in most situations.

### Responding to Introductions

When someone introduces themselves to you, appropriate responses include:

* こちらこそ (*kochira koso*) - "Likewise"
* 私もです (*watashi mo desu*) - "Me too"
* よろしくお願いします (*yoroshiku onegaishimasu*) - "Please treat me well"

### Common Questions in First Meetings

| Japanese Question                   | Pronunciation                         | English Translation                     |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| お仕事は何ですか                    | *Oshigoto wa nan desu ka*             | "What is your job?"                    |
| 趣味は何ですか                      | *Shumi wa nan desu ka*                | "What are your hobbies?"               |
| 日本語が話せますか                  | *Nihongo ga hanasemasu ka*            | "Can you speak Japanese?"              |
| いつ日本に来ましたか                | *Itsu Nihon ni kimashita ka*          | "When did you come to Japan?"          |
| 日本は初めてですか                  | *Nihon wa hajimete desu ka*           | "Is this your first time in Japan?"    |

### Cultural Aspects of Japanese Greetings

1. **Bowing** (お辞儀 *ojigi*): Japanese people typically bow when greeting. The depth and duration of the bow depends on the level of respect being shown:
   * Slight nod (会釈 *eshaku*) - Casual greeting
   * 30-degree bow (敬礼 *keirei*) - Standard business greeting
   * 45-degree or deeper bow (最敬礼 *saikeirei*) - Showing deep respect

2. **Business Card Exchange** (名刺交換 *meishi koukan*): In professional settings, exchanging business cards is important:
   * Give and receive cards with both hands
   * Take time to read the card before putting it away
   * Treat the card with respect (don't write on it or put it in a back pocket)

3. **Honorific Language**: Japanese uses different speech levels depending on the social relationship. For beginners, the polite forms we're learning are appropriate in most situations.

### Common Mistakes

* **Using Casual Forms Too Early**: Using casual language before establishing a close relationship can be seen as rude.
* **Forgetting よろしくお願いします**: This phrase is essential in introductions.
* **Direct Translation of "Nice to Meet You"**: Saying 会えてうれしいです (*aete ureshii desu* - "I'm happy to meet you") instead of the standard はじめまして (*hajimemashite*).
* **Inappropriate First-Person Pronouns**: Using gendered pronouns like 僕 (*boku*) or あたし (*atashi*) in formal settings.

### Quick Practice

Practice these introduction scenarios:

1. Introduce yourself formally with your name, country, and occupation.
2. Ask someone what their name is.
3. Tell someone you're a student (学生 *gakusei*).
4. Say "Nice to meet you. I'm from [your country]. Please treat me well."
5. Ask someone if they can speak English.
6. Say goodbye and that you'll see them tomorrow.
