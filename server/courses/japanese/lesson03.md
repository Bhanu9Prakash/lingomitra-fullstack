## Lesson 3: Counting & Basic Numbers in Japanese

Mastering numbers in Japanese will help you navigate many everyday situations. Japanese has an interesting number system with some similarities to English, but also some unique features—including special counters for different types of objects.

### The Basic Japanese Numbers: 0-10

Let's start with the core numbers from 0-10. These form the foundation of the entire number system:

| Number | Japanese | Pronunciation   | Connection/Memory Tip                     |
|--------|----------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 0      | 零・ゼロ  | *rei* / *zero*   | Both *rei* and *zero* are used           |
| 1      | 一      | *ichi*          | Think: "itchy *one* finger"               |
| 2      | 二      | *ni*            | Easy: "need *two*"                        |
| 3      | 三      | *san*           | Like San Francisco = *3*rd largest city in CA |
| 4      | 四      | *shi* / *yon*    | "She" has *4* letters (use *yon* often as *shi* also means death) |
| 5      | 五      | *go*            | "Five" = "*go*"                           |
| 6      | 六      | *roku*          | Think: "Rock *six*"                       |
| 7      | 七      | *shichi* / *nana* | "She eats *seven*" (*nana* is often used to avoid confusion) |
| 8      | 八      | *hachi*         | Think: *8* sides in a stop sign = *hachi*-gon |
| 9      | 九      | *kyuu* / *ku*    | "CUE" sounds like *kyuu* (*9*)            |
| 10     | 十      | *juu*           | "Jew" sounds like *juu* (*10*)            |

> **Cultural Note**: The numbers 4 (*shi*) and 9 (*ku*) are sometimes considered unlucky because *shi* also means "death" and *ku* can suggest "suffering." For this reason, alternative pronunciations *yon* and *kyuu* are often used.

### Building Numbers 11-99: Combining in Tens

Japanese builds teen numbers and beyond with a straightforward pattern—much simpler than English's "eleven, twelve, thirteen" irregularities.

**Formula for Teens**: **10 + Number**
- 11 = 十一 (*juu ichi*) = "ten-one"
- 12 = 十二 (*juu ni*) = "ten-two"
- 19 = 十九 (*juu kyuu*) = "ten-nine"

**Formula for Tens**: **Number × 10**
- 20 = 二十 (*ni juu*) = "two-ten"
- 30 = 三十 (*san juu*) = "three-ten"
- 90 = 九十 (*kyuu juu*) = "nine-ten"

**Formula for Other Numbers**: **Tens + Units**
- 21 = 二十一 (*ni juu ichi*) = "two-ten-one"
- 47 = 四十七 (*yon juu nana*) = "four-ten-seven"
- 85 = 八十五 (*hachi juu go*) = "eight-ten-five"

> **Thinking Point**: This system is similar to Chinese and Korean, and is actually more logical than English! In English, we say "twenty-one" (20+1), but for teens, we reverse it: "sixteen" (6+10). Japanese is consistent across all numbers.

### Larger Numbers: 100, 1,000, 10,000

| Number     | Japanese   | Pronunciation   | How It's Used                                 |
|------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 100        | 百        | *hyaku*         | 100 = 百 (*hyaku*), 200 = 二百 (*ni-hyaku*)   |
| 1,000      | 千        | *sen*           | 1,000 = 千 (*sen*), 5,000 = 五千 (*go-sen*)   |
| 10,000     | 万        | *man*           | 10,000 = 一万 (*ichi-man*)                    |
| 100,000,000| 億        | *oku*           | 100,000,000 = 一億 (*ichi-oku*)               |

**Examples of Larger Numbers**:
- 248 = 二百四十八 (*ni-hyaku yon-juu hachi*) = "two-hundred four-ten-eight"
- 3,672 = 三千六百七十二 (*san-zen rop-pyaku nana-juu ni*) = "three-thousand six-hundred seven-ten-two" 
- 25,000 = 二万五千 (*ni-man go-sen*) = "two-ten-thousand five-thousand"

> **Note**: Some sound changes occur when numbers combine. For example, 六百 (600) is pronounced *rop-pyaku* not *roku-hyaku*. We'll address these as needed.

### Important Difference: 10,000 vs. 1,000 as the Grouping Unit

While English groups numbers by thousands (thousand, million, billion), **Japanese groups by ten thousands**:

| English  | Japanese  | Japanese Value |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Thousand | 千 *sen*  | 1,000         |
| Ten Thousand | 万 *man* | 10,000      |
| Hundred Million | 億 *oku* | 100,000,000 |
| Trillion | 兆 *chou* | 1,000,000,000,000 |

So rather than thinking "hundred thousand," think "ten ten-thousands" (十万 *juu-man*).

### Counters - A Unique Feature

Japanese uses special "counter" words depending on what you're counting. This is similar to English expressions like "two sheets of paper" or "three loaves of bread," but much more extensive.

We'll cover these in depth later, but here are a few common ones:

| Counter | Used For         | Example                                       |
|---------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| つ *-tsu* | General objects (up to 9) | りんご三つ (*ringo mittsu* - three apples)      |
| 人 *-nin* | People           | 学生二人 (*gakusei futari* - two students)       |
| 本 *-hon* | Long, cylindrical things | 鉛筆三本 (*enpitsu sanbon* - three pencils)   |
| 枚 *-mai* | Flat, thin things | 紙二枚 (*kami nimai* - two sheets of paper)    |
| 台 *-dai* | Machines, vehicles | 車一台 (*kuruma ichidai* - one car)           |

> **Thinking Point**: The counter comes *after* the number and the item being counted. The pronunciation of numbers often changes slightly when used with counters (e.g., 一人 is *hitori*, not *ichinin*).

### Telling Time

**Hours**: Use the number + 時 (*ji*) for hours
- 1:00 = 一時 (*ichi-ji*)
- 9:00 = 九時 (*ku-ji*)

**Minutes**: Use the number + 分 (*fun/pun*) for minutes
- 5 minutes = 五分 (*go-fun*)
- 30 minutes = 三十分 (*sanjup-pun*)

**Complete time expressions**:
- 3:45 = 三時四十五分 (*san-ji yonjuu-go fun*) - "three hour forty-five minute"
- 9:15 = 九時十五分 (*ku-ji juugo-fun*) - "nine hour fifteen minute"

### Common Mistakes

* **Counting Objects Without Counters**: In Japanese, saying "three books" requires the appropriate counter (三冊の本 *sansatsu no hon*), not just the number.
* **Forgetting Number Sound Changes**: Some numbers change pronunciation with counters (e.g., 一 *ichi* becomes *ip-* in 一匹 *ippiki* - one small animal).
* **Mixing English & Japanese Number Grouping**: Remember that Japanese groups by 10,000s, not 1,000s.
* **Using Wrong Number Pronunciation**: Using *shi* (4) or *shichi* (7) when *yon* and *nana* would be clearer.

### Quick Practice

Try expressing these numbers and quantities in Japanese:

1. 16
2. 42
3. 307
4. 5,280
5. What time is it? 3:30
6. Three people
7. Two cars

***Practice Answers:***
1. 十六 (*juu roku*)
2. 四十二 (*yon juu ni*)
3. 三百七 (*sanbyaku nana*)
4. 五千二百八十 (*go-sen ni-hyaku hachi-juu*)
5. 今何時ですか？三時半です。(*Ima nanji desu ka? Sanji han desu.*) - "Now what time is it? Three o'clock half is." Note: 半 (*han*) means "half past" and is commonly used instead of 三十分 (*sanjuppun*).
