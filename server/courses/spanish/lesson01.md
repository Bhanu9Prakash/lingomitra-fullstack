## Lesson 1: Building Your First Spanish Sentences - Verbs, Pronouns & Pronunciation

Welcome! In this foundational lesson, we'll unlock the basics of forming simple Spanish sentences. We'll learn how to say *who* is doing something and how the *action word* (verb) changes. Plus, we'll get comfortable with some essential Spanish sounds. Forget rote memorization; we're focusing on patterns and connections to English.

### The Building Blocks: Who is Who? (Pronouns)

First, let's meet the words for *who* is performing the action. Pay attention to the sounds!

*(**Pronunciation Key:** Spanish pronunciation is quite consistent once you learn it. The vowels are clear and pure: 'a' like in 'father', 'e' like in 'pet', 'i' like in 'machine', 'o' like in 'note', 'u' like in 'rule'. The letter 'j' is pronounced like a strong 'h', 'll' is similar to 'y' in 'yes', and 'ñ' is like 'ny' in 'canyon'.)*

| Spanish    | Pronunciation Hint        | English                  | Intuitive Hint                                           |
|------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **yo**     | *yo* (soft 'y')           | I                        | Unique sound, central to speaking about yourself.        |
| **tú**     | *too* (with accent)       | You (informal, singular) | Use with one friend, family member, child.               |
| **él**     | *el* (with accent)        | He                       | Notice the accent to distinguish from the article 'el'.   |
| **ella**   | *eh-ya*                   | She                      | The double 'll' creates the 'y' sound.                   |
| **usted**  | *oo-sted*                 | You (formal, singular)   | Use with strangers, officials, elders. Often abbreviated as Ud. |
| **nosotros** | *no-so-tros*            | We (masculine/mixed)     | For groups including at least one male.                  |
| **nosotras** | *no-so-tras*            | We (feminine)            | For groups of all females.                               |
| **vosotros** | *bo-so-tros*            | You (informal, plural, Spain) | Used mainly in Spain for groups you know well.      |
| **vosotras** | *bo-so-tras*            | You (informal, plural, feminine, Spain) | Female groups in Spain.                  |
| **ellos**  | *eh-yos*                  | They (masculine/mixed)   | For groups with at least one male.                       |
| **ellas**  | *eh-yas*                  | They (feminine)          | For groups of all females.                               |
| **ustedes** | *oo-steh-des*            | You (formal plural/all plural in Latin America) | Used formally in Spain and as the only plural 'you' in Latin America. Often abbreviated as Uds. |

> **Thinking Point: The Many "Yous"**
> Spanish makes several distinctions that English doesn't:
> * Formal vs. informal: `tú` vs. `usted` (singular); `vosotros/as` vs. `ustedes` (plural)
> * Gender in 'we' and 'you plural': `nosotros` vs. `nosotras`; `vosotros` vs. `vosotras`
> * Regional differences: `vosotros/as` is used in Spain, while Latin America uses `ustedes` for all plural 'you' situations.
> 
> When in doubt, using `usted/ustedes` is safer as it's considered respectful in all contexts.

### The Action Words: Verbs & Their Endings

Most basic Spanish verbs in their dictionary form (the *infinitive*) end with **-ar**, **-er**, or **-ir**. Think of this like "to..." in English (e.g., "to go", "to see").

Examples:
* **hablar** (*ah-blar*) = to talk/speak
* **comer** (*ko-mer*) = to eat
* **vivir** (*bee-beer*) = to live

To use a verb in a sentence, we typically do two things:
1. Find the **verb stem** (or **raíz**): Remove the **-ar/-er/-ir** ending.
   * `hablar` -> `habl`
   * `comer` -> `com`
   * `vivir` -> `viv`
2. Add a specific **ending** based on *who* (the pronoun) is doing the action.

**Let's see this with `hablar` (to speak) - Stem: `habl`**

This pattern works for most regular **-ar** verbs:

|---------------|------|--------|----------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| yo            | habl | **-o** | habl**o**      | *ah-blo*      | `-o` ending is unique to 'I' forms.                    |
| tú            | habl | **-as**| habl**as**     | *ah-blas*     | `-as` for 'you' informal singular.                     |
| él/ella/usted | habl | **-a** | habl**a**      | *ah-bla*      | `-a` for 'he/she/formal you'.                          |
| nosotros/as   | habl | **-amos**| habl**amos** | *ah-bla-mos*  | `-amos` for 'we' (either gender).                      |
| vosotros/as   | habl | **-áis**| habl**áis**   | *ah-bla-ees*  | `-áis` for 'you all' informal (Spain).                 |
| ellos/ellas/ustedes| habl| **-an**| habl**an** | *ah-blan*     | `-an` for 'they/you all formal'.                       |

**Pattern for regular **-er** verbs like `comer` (to eat) - Stem: `com`**

|---------------|------|--------|----------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| yo            | com  | **-o** | com**o**       | *ko-mo*       | Same `-o` as -ar verbs!                              |
| tú            | com  | **-es**| com**es**      | *ko-mes*      | Note the difference from -ar (`-es` not `-as`)       |
| él/ella/usted | com  | **-e** | com**e**       | *ko-me*       | Note the difference from -ar (`-e` not `-a`)         |
| nosotros/as   | com  | **-emos**| com**emos**  | *ko-me-mos*   | Note the difference from -ar (`-emos` not `-amos`)   |
| vosotros/as   | com  | **-éis**| com**éis**    | *ko-meh-ees*  | Similar pattern to -ar but with `e` instead of `a`   |
| ellos/ellas/ustedes| com| **-en**| com**en**   | *ko-men*      | Note the difference from -ar (`-en` not `-an`)       |

**Pattern for regular **-ir** verbs like `vivir` (to live) - Stem: `viv`**

| Pronoun       | Stem | Ending | Full Verb      | Pronunciation | Notes                                                |
|---------------|------|--------|----------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| yo            | viv  | **-o** | viv**o**       | *bee-bo*      | Same `-o` as both -ar and -er verbs!                 |
| tú            | viv  | **-es**| viv**es**      | *bee-bes*     | Same as -er verbs                                    |
| él/ella/usted | viv  | **-e** | viv**e**       | *bee-be*      | Same as -er verbs                                    |
| nosotros/as   | viv  | **-imos**| viv**imos**  | *bee-bee-mos* | Different from both -ar and -er verbs               |
| vosotros/as   | viv  | **-ís**| viv**ís**      | *bee-bees*    | Different from both -ar and -er verbs               |
| ellos/ellas/ustedes| viv| **-en**| viv**en**   | *bee-ben*     | Same as -er verbs                                    |

> **Spot the Pattern!** All verbs use `-o` for "yo" forms. The -er and -ir verbs share many endings with each other but differ from -ar verbs. Notice how nosotros/as forms all end in `-mos`.

> **A Quick Note on "Irregular" Verbs:** Some very common Spanish verbs don't follow the regular patterns (e.g., `ser` - to be, `estar` - to be, `ir` - to go, `tener` - to have). We'll cover these specifically in future lessons. For now, focus on mastering the regular patterns.

### Building Simple Sentences: Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)

Good news! Basic Spanish sentence structure is often the same as English:

**Subject (Who) - Verb (Action, conjugated) - Object (What/Whom)**

Let's try making sentences with our new verbs and pronouns. Remember to match the verb ending to the subject!

* **Yo hablo español.** (*Yo ah-blo es-pa-nyol.*)
  * Subject: `Yo` (I)
  * Verb: `hablo` (from `hablar`, with `-o` ending for `yo`)
  * Object: `español` (Spanish language)
  * Meaning: I speak Spanish.

* **Tú estudias historia.** (*Too es-too-dee-as ees-to-ria.*)
  * Subject: `Tú` (You, informal sing.)
  * Verb: `estudias` (from `estudiar`, with `-as` ending for `tú`)
  * Object: `historia` (history)
  * Meaning: You study history.

* **Ella come pizza.** (*Eh-ya co-me peet-sa.*)
  * Subject: `Ella` (She)
  * Verb: `come` (from `comer`, with `-e` ending for `ella`)
  * Object: `pizza` (pizza)
  * Meaning: She eats pizza.

* **Nosotros vivimos en Madrid.** (*No-so-tros bee-bee-mos en Ma-drid.*)
  * Subject: `Nosotros` (We)
  * Verb: `vivimos` (from `vivir`, with `-imos` ending for `nosotros`)
  * Object/Place: `en Madrid` (in Madrid)
  * Meaning: We live in Madrid.

### Common Mistakes & Thinking Traps

* **Mixing Up Verb Endings:** Using `-as` with -er verbs or `-es` with -ar verbs. **Think:** The ending must match both the verb type (-ar/-er/-ir) AND the person doing it.
* **Including Pronouns Unnecessarily:** In Spanish, the verb ending already indicates who's doing the action, so pronouns are often omitted except for clarity or emphasis. "Hablo español" is more common than "Yo hablo español."
* **Pronunciation Pitfalls:** Pronouncing 'j' like English 'j' instead of 'h', or pronouncing 'll' as 'l' instead of 'y'. **Think:** Train your ear for these unique Spanish sounds.
* **Forgetting Gender in Pronouns:** Using `nosotros` when referring to an all-female group instead of `nosotras`. **Think:** Gender matters in Spanish pronouns.

### Quick Practice: Think it Through!

Translate these sentences into Spanish. Focus on choosing the right pronoun, finding the verb stem, adding the correct ending, and keeping the SVO order. Use the vocabulary list and pronunciation hints.

1. I cook dinner. (Use "la cena" - *la se-na* - for "dinner")
2. You (informal, singular) dance well. (Use "bien" - *bee-en* - for "well")
3. She reads a book. (Use "un libro" - *un lee-bro* - for "a book")
4. We (mixed/masculine) buy a car. (Use "un coche" - *un co-che* - for "a car")
5. They (feminine) live in Barcelona. (Use "en Barcelona" - *en Bar-se-lo-na* - for "in Barcelona")
6. You (formal, singular) work a lot. (Use "mucho" - *moo-cho* - for "a lot")

*(Pause and try to construct the sentences yourself before checking!)*

---

***Practice Answers:***

1. *(Yo) cocino la cena.*
2. *(Tú) bailas bien.*
3. *(Ella) lee un libro.*
4. *(Nosotros) compramos un coche.*
5. *(Ellas) viven en Barcelona.*
6. *(Usted) trabaja mucho.*
