## Lesson 5: Saying Hello & Goodbye - Spanish Greetings (Saludos)

Greetings are your entry point into any conversation! Spanish has different greetings depending on the time of day, the region, and how well you know the person. Let's learn the most common ones.

### Basic Hellos

These are versatile ways to greet someone.

| English | Spanish     | Pronunciation Hint | Intuitive Usage Note                                      |
|---------|------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Hello   | **Hola**   | *oh-lah*           | The most common, all-purpose greeting. Safe in all situations. |
| Hi      | **Hola**   | *oh-lah*           | Same as "Hello" - Spanish doesn't distinguish between formal/informal "hello" as distinctly as English. |
| Hey     | **Ey**     | *eh*               | Very informal, similar to English "Hey". Use with close friends. Primarily used by younger people. |

### Greetings Based on Time of Day

These are common and add a bit more politeness, especially in more formal settings.

|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Good morning    | **Buenos días**    | *bweh-nohs dee-ahs*             | "Good days". Use until around noon.                               |
| Good afternoon  | **Buenas tardes**  | *bweh-nahs tar-dehs*            | "Good afternoons". Use from noon until sunset (around 6-8 PM).    |
| Good evening    | **Buenas noches**  | *bweh-nahs no-chehs*            | "Good nights". Use after sunset and into the night.               |
| Good night (farewell)| **Buenas noches** | *bweh-nahs no-chehs*        | Unlike English, Spanish uses the same phrase for evening greetings and nighttime farewells. |

> **Thinking Point: Gender Agreement**
> Notice the gender agreement between "buenos/buenas" and "días/tardes/noches". In Spanish, adjectives must agree with the gender of the noun they modify:
> * "Día" is masculine, so we say "buenos días".
> * "Tarde" and "noche" are feminine, so we say "buenas tardes" and "buenas noches".
> This pattern of gender agreement is crucial in Spanish grammar.

### Asking "How Are You?"

### Special Greeting Customs

In addition to verbal greetings, Spanish-speaking cultures often include physical greetings:

* **One kiss on the cheek** - Common between women and between men and women in many Spanish-speaking countries (not usual between men).
* **Abrazo** (hug) - Common among friends and family.
* **Handshake** - Common in formal or professional situations.

### Common Mistakes

* **Pronunciation of "Hola":** Pronouncing the 'h' in "Hola" (it's silent, so it sounds like "oh-la").
* **Using "Buenos días" at the Wrong Time:** Using morning greetings in the afternoon or evening.
* **Forgetting Gender Agreement:** Saying "bueno días" instead of "buenos días" or "bueno tardes" instead of "buenas tardes".
* **Excessive Formality/Informality:** Using very formal greetings with close friends or informal greetings in professional settings.
* **Direct Translation of Expressions:** Translating English expressions directly when Spanish has its own equivalent (e.g., saying "Buena noche" for "Good night" instead of "Buenas noches").

### Quick Practice

How would you say the following in Spanish? Consider the context!

1. Greet your professor in the morning.
2. Say "hello" to a friend.
3. Ask a friend how they are doing (informally).
4. Say "nice to meet you" to someone you just met in a formal setting.
5. Say goodbye to a friend when you'll see them tomorrow.
6. Say goodbye to your boss in the evening.

*(Think about formality and time of day!)*
