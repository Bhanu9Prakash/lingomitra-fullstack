## Lesson 2: Decoding Spanish Sounds - The Alphabet & Pronunciation

Welcome back! Now that you know how to build basic sentences, let's focus on how Spanish *sounds*. Good news: Spanish pronunciation is very consistent. Once you learn the sound for each letter or combination, you can reliably pronounce most words. Many sounds are similar to English, but there are a few key differences and special characters to learn.

### The Spanish Alphabet (El alfabeto español)

The Spanish alphabet has 27 letters, including the standard 26 letters from English plus the special letter 'ñ'.

*(**Quick Pronunciation Key Reminder:** 'a' like in father, 'e' like in pet, 'i' like in machine, 'o' like in note, 'u' like in rule. 'j' = strong 'h', 'll' = 'y', 'ñ' = 'ny')*

### Special Combinations and Sounds

These letter combinations create specific sounds in Spanish:

**1. Consonant Combinations:**

| Combination | Pronunciation | Examples | Meaning |
|-------------|---------------|----------|---------|
| **ch**      | Like 'ch' in **ch**urch | **ch**ico, mu**ch**o | boy, much |
| **ll**      | Like 'y' in **y**es or 'j' in **j**eep (varies by region) | **ll**amar, ca**ll**e | to call, street |
| **rr**      | Strongly rolled 'r' | pe**rr**o, co**rr**er | dog, to run |
| **qu**      | Always 'k' sound (silent 'u') | **qu**é, **qu**iero | what, I want |
| **gu**      | Hard 'g' before e/i (silent 'u') | **gu**erra, **gu**itarra | war, guitar |

**2. Diphthongs (Vowel Combinations):**

When certain vowels appear together, they form diphthongs, which are pronounced as a single syllable.

Strong vowels (a, e, o) + weak vowels (i, u) = diphthong:
* **ai/ay**: like "eye" - b**ai**le (dance)
* **ei/ey**: similar to "hey" - r**ei**no (kingdom)
* **oi/oy**: like "oy" in "boy" - h**oy** (today)
* **au**: like "ow" in "cow" - **au**to (car)
* **eu**: eh+oo together - **Eu**ropa (Europe)
* **ui/uy**: like "we" - c**ui**dado (care)

Two weak vowels (i, u) also form diphthongs:
* **iu**: ee+oo together - c**iu**dad (city)
* **ui**: oo+ee together - r**ui**do (noise)

### Stress and Accents

Spanish uses accent marks (´) to indicate stress or to distinguish between words that would otherwise be spelled the same.

**Rules for Word Stress:**
1. Words ending in a vowel, n, or s: stress falls on the next-to-last syllable
   * Examples: ca-**sa** (house), ha-**blan** (they speak)

2. Words ending in any other consonant: stress falls on the last syllable
   * Examples: ha-**blar** (to speak), es-pa-**ñol** (Spanish)

3. Accent marks override these rules and indicate the stressed syllable
   * Examples: **tá**-xi (taxi), can-**ción** (song)

**Accent Marks for Distinction:**
* **tú** (you) vs. **tu** (your)
* **él** (he) vs. **el** (the)
* **sí** (yes) vs. **si** (if)
* **qué** (what) vs. **que** (that)
* **cómo** (how) vs. **como** (like, as)

### Common Mistakes & Pronunciation Hurdles

* **English 'A' Sound:** Pronouncing 'a' like in English "cat" or "cake" instead of the consistent Spanish 'ah' sound.
* **'H' Sound:** Pronouncing the 'h' when it should be silent (e.g., saying "Hola" with an English 'h' sound).
* **'J' Sound:** Pronouncing 'j' like English 'j' instead of the strong 'h' sound (e.g., saying "Javier" with an English 'j').
* **'LL' Sound:** Pronouncing 'll' as two 'l' sounds instead of the 'y' sound (e.g., saying "calle" as "cal-le" instead of "ca-ye").
* **'Ñ' Sound:** Pronouncing 'ñ' as 'n' instead of 'ny' (e.g., saying "España" as "Espana" instead of "Es-pa-nya").
* **'B' vs. 'V':** Trying to pronounce a clear distinction between 'b' and 'v' when native speakers often don't.
* **'D' Between Vowels:** Not softening the 'd' between vowels (should sound closer to 'th' in "this").
* **'R' Sound:** Not rolling or tapping the 'r' correctly; this takes practice!

### Quick Practice: Sound Check!

Try pronouncing these Spanish words aloud, using the rules and hints you've just learned. Don't worry about perfection, just apply the thinking!

1. casa (house) - *Think: stress on first 'a'*
2. español (Spanish) - *Think: accent mark on 'o'*
3. guitarra (guitar) - *Think: silent 'u', rolled 'rr'*
4. llamar (to call) - *Think: 'll' makes 'y' sound*
5. quiero (I want) - *Think: 'qu' makes 'k' sound, silent 'u'*
6. zapato (shoe) - *Think: 'z' makes 'th' sound in Spain, 's' in Latin America*
7. ciudad (city) - *Think: stress on last syllable, 'iu' diphthong*
8. México (Mexico) - *Think: 'x' makes 'h' sound, accent on 'e'*
9. año (year) - *Think: 'ñ' makes 'ny' sound*
10. familia (family) - *Think: stress on second 'i'*

*(Listen to native speakers pronounce these words online if you can to compare!)*

Mastering pronunciation takes time and practice. By understanding these consistent rules, you're building a strong foundation for both speaking and understanding spoken Spanish. Keep listening and keep practicing!
