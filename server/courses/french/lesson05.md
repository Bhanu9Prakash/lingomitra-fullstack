## Lesson 5: Saying Hello & Goodbye - French Greetings (Les Salutations)

Greetings are your entry point into any conversation! French has different greetings depending on the time of day, how well you know the person, and the level of formality. Let's learn the most common ones.

### Basic Hellos

These are versatile ways to greet someone.

| English | French         | Pronunciation Hint | Intuitive Usage Note                                      |
|---------|----------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Hello   | **Bonjour**    | *bohn-zhoor*       | The most common, all-purpose greeting. Can be used any time during the day. |
| Hello   | **Salut**      | *sah-lew*          | Informal "hi." Use with friends, family, peers, younger people. Not appropriate in formal settings. |
| Hi there| **Coucou**     | *koo-koo*          | Very informal, cute. Use with close friends and family members. |

### Greetings Based on Time of Day

French has fewer time-specific greetings than some languages.

| English         | French                | Pronunciation Hint     | Usage Note                                                 |
|-----------------|----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Good morning/day | **Bonjour**          | *bohn-zhoor*           | Used any time from morning until evening (approximately before 6 PM). |
| Good evening    | **Bonsoir**          | *bohn-swahr*           | Used in the evening, typically after 6 PM.                  |
| Good night      | **Bonne nuit**       | *bon nwee*             | Used only when someone is going to bed/sleep. It's a farewell, not a greeting when arriving somewhere at night. |

> **Cultural Note:** The French don't have separate words for "good morning" and "good afternoon." "Bonjour" covers both, making it simpler but less time-specific than English.

### Formal vs. Informal Greetings: A Quick Summary

Knowing when to be formal or informal is important in French culture.

| Situation                             | Greeting Examples                 | Farewell Examples    | Pronoun to Use |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Formal** (Strangers, officials, older people, business, shops) | Bonjour Monsieur/Madame, Bonsoir | Au revoir, Bonne journée | **vous** (you - formal/plural) |
| **Informal** (Friends, family, children, close colleagues, peers) | Salut, Coucou | Salut, À plus, Ciao | **tu** (you - informal singular) |

### Saying Goodbye (Au revoir)

| English                     | French             | Pronunciation Hint     | Formality & Usage Note                                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Goodbye                     | **Au revoir**      | *oh ruh-vwahr*         | Standard polite farewell. Appropriate in all situations. |
| Goodbye (informal)          | **Salut**          | *sah-lew*              | "Hi" and "bye" in informal situations.                   |
| See you soon                | **À bientôt**      | *ah byen-toh*          | "Until soon," slightly less formal than "au revoir."     |
| See you later/in a bit      | **À tout à l'heure**| *ah too ta luhr*       | "Until later today," casual but not overly informal.     |
| See you later (colloquial)  | **À plus**         | *ah plews*             | Short for "à plus tard" - "see you later," quite casual.  |
| Have a good day             | **Bonne journée**  | *bon zhoor-nay*        | Polite farewell during the day. Useful in shops, etc.    |
| Have a good evening         | **Bonne soirée**   | *bon swah-ray*         | Polite farewell in the evening. Useful in restaurants, etc. |

> **Language Subtlety:** Note the difference between "Bonjour" (hello/good day) and "Bonne journée" (have a good day). The first is a greeting when arriving, the second is a farewell when leaving during daytime hours.

### Asking "How Are You?"

| English                         | French                         | Pronunciation Hint      | Formality & Usage                                              |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| How are you? (Formal)           | **Comment allez-vous ?**       | *ko-mahn-tah-lay-voo*   | Formal. Uses the "vous" form.                                   |
| How are you? (Informal)         | **Comment vas-tu ?**           | *ko-mahn vah-tew*       | Grammatically correct but somewhat stiff in casual situations.  |
| How are you? (Informal, common) | **Ça va ?**                    | *sah vah*               | Very common, casual way to ask "How's it going?"                |
| Are you OK? / How's it going?   | **Tu vas bien ?**              | *tew vah byen*          | Informal. Literally "You're going well?"                        |

**Common responses:**

* **Très bien, merci. Et vous/toi ?** (*tray byen, mair-see. Ay voo/twah*)
  * Very well, thank you. And you? (Use "vous" in formal situations, "toi" in informal ones)

* **Ça va bien, merci.** (*sah vah byen, mair-see*)
  * I'm doing well, thanks.

* **Pas mal.** (*pah mal*)
  * Not bad.

* **Comme ci, comme ça.** (*kom see, kom sah*)
  * So-so. (Literally: Like this, like that.)

### Essential Polite Expressions

| English                         | French                      | Pronunciation Hint     |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Please                          | **S'il vous plaît**        | *seel voo play*        |
| Thank you                       | **Merci**                  | *mair-see*             |
| Thank you very much             | **Merci beaucoup**         | *mair-see bo-koo*      |
| You're welcome                  | **De rien**                | *duh ree-en*           |
| You're welcome (more polite)    | **Je vous en prie**        | *zhuh voo zahn pree*   |
| Excuse me (to get attention)    | **Excusez-moi**            | *ex-kew-zay mwah*      |
| I'm sorry                       | **Je suis désolé(e)**      | *zhuh swee day-zo-lay* |
| No problem                      | **Pas de problème**        | *pah duh pro-blem*     |

> **Cultural Note:** The French place a high value on politeness. Always using "Bonjour" before asking for something in a shop or restaurant is considered basic good manners. Forgetting to say hello before asking a question can be perceived as rude.

### Common Mistakes

*   **Using `Bonne nuit` as a greeting:** Saying `Bonne nuit` when arriving somewhere late in the evening. It's strictly a "going to bed" farewell. Use `Bonsoir` instead.
*   **Forgetting to say "Bonjour" first:** Immediately asking a question without greeting someone first. Always start with a greeting.
*   **Using `tu` with strangers:** Being overly familiar with people you don't know well. Use `vous` until invited to use `tu`.
*   **Confusing "Bonjour" and "Bonne journée":** Using the wrong one for greeting versus farewell. "Bonjour" is for greeting, "Bonne journée" is for saying goodbye.

### Quick Practice

1.  Greet your teacher when you arrive for class in the morning.
2.  Say "hi" to a friend you run into on the street.
3.  Ask your friend casually how they're doing.
4.  Say goodbye politely to a shopkeeper in the evening.
5.  Tell a waiter "thank you very much" after they bring your food.
