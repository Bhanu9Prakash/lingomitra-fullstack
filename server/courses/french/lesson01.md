## Lesson 1: Building Your First French Sentences - Verbs, Pronouns & Pronunciation

Welcome! In this foundational lesson, we'll unlock the basics of forming simple French sentences. We'll learn how to say *who* is doing something and how the *action word* (verb) changes. Plus, we'll get comfortable with some essential French sounds. Forget rote memorization; we're focusing on patterns and connections to English.

### The Building Blocks: Who is Who? (Pronouns)

First, let's meet the words for *who* is performing the action. Pay attention to the sounds!

*(**Pronunciation Key:** We'll use simple English approximations. 'eu' is like the 'u' in 'butter' but with rounded lips. 'ou' is like 'oo' in 'food'. 'u' is tricky - like 'ee' but with rounded lips. 'j' is like 's' in 'pleasure'. 'r' is pronounced in the back of the throat. Nasal sounds (an, in, on) are pronounced through the nose without closing with the 'n' sound.)*

| French     | Pronunciation Hint       | English                  | Intuitive Hint                                           |
|------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **je**     | *zhuh* (soft 'j' sound)  | I                        | Short, simple sound for talking about yourself.          |
| **tu**     | *tü* (lips rounded)      | You (informal, singular) | Use with one friend, family member, child.               |
| **il**     | *eel*                    | He                       | Short and simple like "eel" in English.                   |
| **elle**   | *el* (like "L" letter)   | She                      | Sounds close to the letter "L" in English.                |
| **on**     | *ohn* (nasal)            | One/We (informal)        | Used for general statements or as informal "we".          |
| **nous**   | *noo*                    | We                       | Sounds close to English "new" without the "y" sound.      |
| **vous**   | *voo*                    | You (formal or plural)   | Use for strangers, officials, or multiple people.         |
| **ils**    | *eel* (silent 's')       | They (masculine/mixed)   | Same sound as 'il' - the 's' is silent!                  |
| **elles**  | *el* (silent 's')        | They (feminine only)     | Same sound as 'elle' - the 's' is silent!                |

> **Thinking Point: The Many "Yous"**
> Unlike modern English, French distinguishes:
> *   `tu`: one person you know well.
> *   `vous`: multiple people OR one person you're addressing formally.
> This politeness distinction is important in French culture. When in doubt, use `vous`.

### The Action Words: Verbs & Their Endings

Most basic French verbs in their dictionary form (the *infinitive*) end with **-er**. Think of this like "to..." in English (e.g., "to go", "to see").

Examples:
*   **parler** (*par-lay*) = to speak
*   **manger** (*mahn-zhay*) = to eat
*   **jouer** (*zhoo-ay*) = to play

To use a verb in a sentence, we typically do two things:
1.  Find the **verb stem** (or **root**): Remove the **-er** ending.
    *   `parler` -> `parl`
    *   `manger` -> `mang`
    *   `jouer` -> `jou`
2.  Add a specific **ending** based on *who* (the pronoun) is doing the action.

**Let's see this with `parler` (to speak) - Root: `parl`**

This pattern works for MOST regular -ER verbs:

| Pronoun    | Root | Ending | Full Verb      | Pronunciation | How to Think About It                                  |
|------------|------|--------|----------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| je         | parl | **-e** | parl**e**      | *parl*        | Silent ending but necessary in writing.                |
| tu         | parl | **-es**| parl**es**     | *parl*        | Also silent ending but the 's' appears in writing.    |
| il/elle/on | parl | **-e** | parl**e**      | *parl*        | Silent ending like with 'je'.                          |
| nous       | parl | **-ons**| parl**ons**   | *par-lohn*    | A fully pronounced ending with a nasal sound.         |
| vous       | parl | **-ez**| parl**ez**     | *par-lay*     | Sounds like the infinitive - a key giveaway!           |
| ils/elles  | parl | **-ent**| parl**ent**   | *parl*        | Silent ending! This could confuse beginners.           |

> **Spot the Pattern!** Silent `-e`, `-es`, `-ent` endings and pronounced `-ons`, `-ez`. The `nous` and `vous` forms have distinctly pronounced endings.

> **A Quick Note on Spelling Changes:** Some verbs (#13-14) change spelling to maintain pronunciation. For example, `commencer` becomes `je commence` but `nous commençons` (adding a cedilla to keep the soft 'c' sound). `Acheter` becomes `j'achète` (adding a grave accent). Don't worry about mastering these changes right now! We'll tackle them soon in another lesson.

### Building Simple Sentences: Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)

Great news! Basic French sentence structure is often the same as English:

**Subject (Who) - Verb (Action, conjugated) - Object (What/Whom)**

Let's try making sentences with our new verbs and pronouns. Remember to match the verb ending to the subject!

*   **Je parle français.** (*Zhuh parl frahn-say.*)
    *   Subject: `Je` (I)
    *   Verb: `parle` (Root `parl` + `-e` for `je`)
    *   Object: `français` (French language)
    *   Meaning: I speak French.

*   **Nous aimons la pizza.** (*Noo zeh-mohn lah peet-za.*)
    *   Subject: `Nous` (We)
    *   Verb: `aimons` (Root `aim` + `-ons` for `nous`)
    *   Object: `la pizza` (the pizza)
    *   Meaning: We like pizza.

*   **Tu joues au tennis.** (*Tü zhoo oh ten-ees.*)
    *   Subject: `Tu` (You, informal sing.)
    *   Verb: `joues` (Root `jou` + `-es` for `tu`)
    *   Object: `au tennis` (tennis - with required preposition)
    *   Meaning: You play tennis.

*   **Elle habite à Paris.** (*El ah-beet ah pah-ree.*)
    *   Subject: `Elle` (She)
    *   Verb: `habite` (Root `habit` + `-e` for `elle`)
    *   Object/Place: `à Paris` (in Paris)
    *   Meaning: She lives in Paris.

*   **Vous écoutez la musique.** (*Voo zay-koo-tay lah mew-zeek.*)
    *   Subject: `Vous` (You, formal/plural)
    *   Verb: `écoutez` (Root `écout` + `-ez` for `vous`)
    *   Object: `la musique` (the music)
    *   Meaning: You listen to music.

*   **Ils dansent bien.** (*Eel dahns byen.*)
    *   Subject: `Ils` (They, masc.)
    *   Verb: `dansent` (Root `dans` + `-ent` for `ils` - silent ending!)
    *   Adverb: `bien` (well)
    *   Meaning: They dance well.

### Common Mistakes & Thinking Traps

*   **Ignoring Silent Endings:** Writing `Je parl` instead of `Je parle`. Even though the ending is silent, it's required in writing.
*   **Pronouncing Verb Endings that Should Be Silent:** Saying "par-LUH" for `parle` or "par-LUNT" for `parlent`. Remember, the `-e`, `-es`, and `-ent` endings are silent!
*   **Wrongly Assuming Similar Words Mean the Same Thing:** Assuming `actuellement` means "actually" (it means "currently") or that `attendre` means "to attend" (it means "to wait for"). These "false friends" can be tricky.
*   **Forgetting Required Prepositions:** Saying `jouer tennis` instead of `jouer au tennis` or `jouer du piano` (to play the piano). French often needs specific prepositions with verbs.
*   **Pronunciation Pitfalls:** Putting stress on the last syllable, not keeping a steady rhythm, or forgetting to nasalize sounds like "on", "an", "in".

### Quick Practice: Think it Through!

Translate these sentences into French. Focus on choosing the right pronoun, finding the verb root, adding the correct ending, and keeping the SVO order. Use the vocabulary list and pronunciation hints.

1.  We live in Montreal. (Use "à Montréal")
2.  She asks a question. (Use "une question" for "a question")
3.  You (informal, singular) bring the book. (Use "le livre" for "the book", "apporter" for "to bring")
4.  I write an email. (Use "un email" for "an email", "écrire" for "to write" - irregular)
5.  You (formal) sing well. (Use "chanter" for "to sing", "bien" for "well")
6.  They (masculine) look for the key. (Use "chercher" for "to look for", "la clé" for "the key")

*(Pause and try to construct the sentences yourself before checking!)*

***Practice Answers:***

1.  *Nous habitons à Montréal.*
2.  *Elle demande une question.*
3.  *Tu apportes le livre.*
4.  *J'écris un email.* (Note: We use J' before words starting with vowels!)
5.  *Vous chantez bien.*
6.  *Ils cherchent la clé.*

Great job working through this foundational lesson! You've learned the core pronouns, the basic system of verb conjugation for regular verbs, sentence structure, and met 30 essential action words. Keep practicing these patterns, and you'll be building more complex sentences soon!
