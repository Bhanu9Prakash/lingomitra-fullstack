## Lesson 2: Decoding French Sounds - The Alphabet & Pronunciation

Welcome back! Now that you know how to build basic sentences, let's focus on how French *sounds*. French pronunciation can be challenging at first because the written form doesn't always match what you hear. But don't worry - there are consistent patterns that will help you master it.

### The French Alphabet (L'alphabet français)

The French alphabet has the same 26 letters as English, but they're pronounced differently.

### Special Characters and Accent Marks

French uses several accent marks that can change pronunciation or distinguish between similar-looking words.

| Accent    | Example     | Effect                                                              |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Acute (´) | é           | Makes 'e' sound like 'ay' in 'say' (café)                           |
| Grave (`) | è, à, ù     | Makes 'e' sound like 'e' in 'get' (père); distinguishes similar words (a/à) |
| Circumflex (^)| ê, â, î, ô, û | Often indicates a historical lost 's' (hôpital/hospital); subtle sound changes |
| Cedilla (¸) | ç         | Makes 'c' soft (pronounced like 's') before a, o, u (français)      |
| Diaeresis (¨) | ë, ï, ü | Indicates vowels are pronounced separately, not as a diphthong (Noël) |

### Key Pronunciation Patterns

**1. Silent Final Consonants**

Most final consonants in French are not pronounced, with key exceptions:

* The consonants in CaReFuL (C, R, F, L) are often pronounced at the end of words
* Final -s, -t, -d, -p, -g, -x are typically silent
* Example: "petit" (small) is pronounced "puh-tee" (silent 't')

**2. Nasal Vowels**

When vowels are followed by 'm' or 'n' within the same syllable, they often create a nasal sound where the 'm/n' isn't fully pronounced:

| Nasal Sound | Example Words | Pronunciation |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| an/am/en/em | enfant (child), temps (time) | *ahn-fahn*, *tahn* |
| in/im/ain/ein | vin (wine), fin (end), pain (bread) | *vahn*, *fahn*, *pahn* |
| on/om | bon (good), nom (name) | *bohn*, *nohm* |
| un/um | un (one), parfum (perfume) | *uhn*, *par-fuhm* |

> **Thinking Point:** Nasal vowels are distinctive in French and don't exist in English. They're formed by letting air pass through both your mouth AND nose. Don't pronounce the 'n' or 'm' separately—it's one smooth nasal sound.

**3. Liaisons: Connecting Words**

When a word ending with a normally silent consonant is followed by a word beginning with a vowel, the consonant is often pronounced and "linked" to the next word:

* "les amis" (the friends): pronounced "lay-za-mee" (linking the 's' to "amis")
* "nous avons" (we have): pronounced "noo-za-vohn" (linking the 's' to "avons")

**4. Elision: Dropping Vowels**

When certain short words (je, le, la, de, etc.) are followed by a word starting with a vowel or silent h, the vowel in the first word is dropped and replaced with an apostrophe:

* je + ai = j'ai (I have)
* le + ami = l'ami (the friend)
* de + accord = d'accord (agreed)

**5. Rhythm and Stress**

Unlike English which stresses certain syllables within words, French generally:
* Places slight stress on the final syllable of words or phrase groups
* Maintains even rhythm and timing across syllables
* Links words together in sound groups rather than emphasizing individual words

### Common Pronunciation Challenges for English Speakers

**1. The French R**
* The French 'r' is produced in the back of the throat (uvular)
* Try gargling water to feel the right position!
* Practice: rouge (red), Paris, merci (thank you)

**2. The French U**
* No English equivalent; closest is the German 'ü'
* Shape your lips as if saying "oo" but try to say "ee"
* Practice: tu (you), rue (street), jus (juice) 

**3. The Nasal Sounds**
* Let air flow through your nose without closing with the 'n' or 'm'
* Practice: bon (good), vin (wine), blanc (white)

**4. Distinguishing Similar Sounds**
* ou [u] vs u [y]: tout (all) vs tu (you)
* é [e] vs è [ɛ]: été (summer) vs père (father)

### Quick Practice: Sound Check!

Try pronouncing these French words aloud, using the rules and hints you've just learned. Don't worry about perfection, just apply the thinking!

1.  `je` (I) - *Think: soft 'j' sound like 's' in 'pleasure'*
2.  `maison` (house) - *Think: 's' between vowels sounds like 'z'*
3.  `français` (French) - *Think: nasal "an" sound, soft 'ç', silent final 's'*
4.  `petit` (small) - *Think: unstressed 'e', silent final 't'*
5.  `étudiant` (student) - *Think: acute accent on 'é', nasal ending*
6.  `beaucoup` (a lot) - *Think: "o" sound followed by "u" sound*
7.  `merci` (thank you) - *Think: throaty 'r', soft 'c'*
8.  `les amis` (the friends) - *Think: liaison connecting 's' to "amis"*
9.  `je m'appelle` (my name is) - *Think: elision of "je" + "appelle"*
10. `au revoir` (goodbye) - *Think: "o" sound for "au", throaty 'r'*

*(Listen to native speakers pronounce these words online if you can to compare!)*

Mastering pronunciation takes time and practice. By understanding these consistent rules, you're building a strong foundation for both speaking and understanding spoken French. Keep listening and keep practicing!
