## Lesson 6: Making Questions - Yes/No Questions & Question Words

Asking questions is essential for having conversations and gathering information. Chinese has several straightforward ways to form questions, and in this lesson, we'll focus on two main types: yes/no questions and information-seeking questions using question words.

### 1. Yes/No Questions

Chinese has several methods to form yes/no questions (questions that can be answered with "yes" or "no"):

#### A. The Question Particle "吗" (ma)

The simplest way to form a yes/no question is to add the question particle "吗" (ma) to the end of a statement:

**Statement Structure:** Subject + Verb + Object
**Question Structure:** Subject + Verb + Object + 吗

Examples:
* Statement: 你是老师。(Nǐ shì lǎoshī.) - You are a teacher.
* Question: 你是老师吗？(Nǐ shì lǎoshī ma?) - Are you a teacher?

* Statement: 他有车。(Tā yǒu chē.) - He has a car.
* Question: 他有车吗？(Tā yǒu chē ma?) - Does he have a car?

> **Thinking Point:** Adding 吗 (ma) is like adding a question mark to your voice in English. It transforms any statement into a yes/no question without changing the word order.

#### B. The V-not-V Pattern

Another common way to form yes/no questions is the "verb-not-verb" (V-不-V) pattern:

**Structure:** Subject + Verb + 不 + Verb + Object

Examples:
* 你是不是老师？(Nǐ shì bú shì lǎoshī?) - Are you a teacher? (Literally: "You are-not-are teacher?")
* 他有没有车？(Tā yǒu méi yǒu chē?) - Does he have a car? (Literally: "He have-not-have car?")

> **Important Note:** For the verb 有 (yǒu - to have), the negative form in questions is 没有 (méi yǒu), not 不有 (bú yǒu). So we say 有没有 (yǒu méi yǒu) instead of 有不有 (yǒu bú yǒu).

#### Answering Yes/No Questions

Unlike English, Chinese typically doesn't use single words like "yes" or "no" to answer questions. Instead, answers generally repeat the verb:

Question: 你是学生吗？(Nǐ shì xuésheng ma?) - Are you a student?
* Affirmative: 是，我是学生。(Shì, wǒ shì xuésheng.) - Yes, I am a student.
* Negative: 不是，我不是学生。(Bú shì, wǒ bú shì xuésheng.) - No, I am not a student.

Question: 你有时间吗？(Nǐ yǒu shíjiān ma?) - Do you have time?
* Affirmative: 有，我有时间。(Yǒu, wǒ yǒu shíjiān.) - Yes, I have time.
* Negative: 没有，我没有时间。(Méi yǒu, wǒ méi yǒu shíjiān.) - No, I don't have time.

> **Thinking Point:** Rather than generic "yes/no" words, Chinese uses the verb from the question to answer, making responses very specific to what was asked.

### 2. Question Words (Wh-Questions)

Question words (like "what," "who," "where" in English) allow you to ask for specific information. In Chinese, these question words typically remain in the same position as the information they're asking about:

| Chinese | Pinyin   | Meaning    | Example Sentence                                           |
|---------|----------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 什么    | shénme   | what       | 这是什么？(Zhè shì shénme?) - What is this?               |
| 谁      | shuí/shéi| who        | 他是谁？(Tā shì shuí?) - Who is he?                        |
| 哪里/哪儿 | nǎlǐ/nǎr  | where      | 你的书在哪里？(Nǐ de shū zài nǎlǐ?) - Where is your book? |
| 为什么  | wèishénme| why        | 你为什么学中文？(Nǐ wèishénme xué Zhōngwén?) - Why do you study Chinese? |
| 什么时候 | shénme shíhou | when    | 我们什么时候吃饭？(Wǒmen shénme shíhou chīfàn?) - When do we eat? |
| 怎么    | zěnme    | how        | 你怎么学中文？(Nǐ zěnme xué Zhōngwén?) - How do you study Chinese? |
| 几      | jǐ       | how many (few) | 你有几本书？(Nǐ yǒu jǐ běn shū?) - How many books do you have? |
| 多少    | duōshao  | how many/much | 这个多少钱？(Zhège duōshao qián?) - How much money is this? |

> **Thinking Point:** Unlike in English, Chinese question words stay exactly where the answer would go in a statement. For example, in the statement "He is John," (他是约翰) "John" is after "is." So the question "Who is he?" keeps the question word "who" (谁) in that same position: 他是谁？

### 3. Combining Question Types

Some questions combine both question words and yes/no question structures:

* 你知道他是谁吗？(Nǐ zhīdào tā shì shuí ma?) - Do you know who he is?
* 你知不知道她什么时候来？(Nǐ zhī bù zhīdào tā shénme shíhou lái?) - Do you know when she's coming?

### 4. Special Question Structures

#### A. Questions about Existence/Location: 有没有 (yǒu méi yǒu)
To ask if something exists or is available somewhere:

* 这里有没有咖啡？(Zhèlǐ yǒu méi yǒu kāfēi?) - Is there coffee here?
* 附近有没有银行？(Fùjìn yǒu méi yǒu yínháng?) - Is there a bank nearby?

#### B. Alternatives with 还是 (háishi - or)
To present options in a question:

* 你喝茶还是咖啡？(Nǐ hē chá háishi kāfēi?) - Do you drink tea or coffee?
* 我们今天去还是明天去？(Wǒmen jīntiān qù háishi míngtiān qù?) - Do we go today or tomorrow?

> **Thinking Point:** This structure doesn't use 吗 or the V-not-V pattern because you're presenting choices rather than asking for a yes/no answer.

#### C. Tag Questions with 对不对 (duì bú duì) or 是不是 (shì bú shì)
To confirm something, similar to "right?" or "isn't it?" in English:

* 你是老师，对不对？(Nǐ shì lǎoshī, duì bú duì?) - You are a teacher, right?
* 他会说中文，是不是？(Tā huì shuō Zhōngwén, shì bú shì?) - He can speak Chinese, isn't that so?

### Common Mistakes & Thinking Traps

*   **Adding Final Particles to Wh-Questions:** Adding 吗 to a question that already has a question word, like ~~"这是什么吗？"~~ This is redundant - just use 这是什么？
*   **Incorrect Word Order with Question Words:** Placing question words at the beginning of a sentence as in English, like ~~"什么这是？"~~ for "What is this?" The correct order is 这是什么？
*   **Using 不 Instead of 没 with 有:** Saying ~~"他有不有时间？"~~ instead of 他有没有时间？
*   **Answering Just "Yes" or "No":** Using only 是 or 不 without repeating the verb can sound incomplete or impolite.

### Quick Practice

Translate these questions into Chinese:

1. Are you Chinese?
2. What is your name?
3. Where do you live?
4. Do you speak English or Chinese?
5. Why do you learn Chinese?
6. How many people are there in your family?
7. Is this your book?
8. When do you go to school?
