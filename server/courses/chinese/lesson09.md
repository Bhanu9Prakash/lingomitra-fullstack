## Lesson 9: Basic Negation - Saying "No" and "Not"

Expressing negation is essential in any language. In this lesson, we'll explore how to say "no," "not," and form negative statements in Chinese.

### 1. Basic Negation with 不 (bù)

The most common negation word in Chinese is 不 (bù), which translates as "not" or "don't." It's placed directly before the verb or adjective being negated:

**Structure:** Subject + 不 + Verb/Adjective + Object

Examples:
* 我不去。(Wǒ bù qù.) - I'm not going./I don't go.
* 他不喜欢咖啡。(Tā bù xǐhuān kāfēi.) - He doesn't like coffee.
* 这不是我的书。(Zhè bú shì wǒ de shū.) - This is not my book.
* 那个人不高。(Nàge rén bù gāo.) - That person is not tall.

> **Thinking Point:** Unlike English, which often needs "do/does" auxiliary verbs for present tense negation, Chinese simply puts 不 directly before the verb.

### 2. Negating Existence and Possession with 没(有) (méi(yǒu))

To negate past actions, existence, or possession, Chinese uses 没 (méi) or 没有 (méiyǒu):

**Structure:** Subject + 没(有) + Verb/Object

Examples:
* 我没有车。(Wǒ méi yǒu chē.) - I don't have a car.
* 这里没有人。(Zhèlǐ méi yǒu rén.) - There is no one here./There isn't anyone here.
* 我昨天没去学校。(Wǒ zuótiān méi qù xuéxiào.) - I didn't go to school yesterday.
* 他没吃午饭。(Tā méi chī wǔfàn.) - He didn't eat lunch.

> **Important Distinction:** 
> * Use 不 for habitual/regular negation, willingness, or future actions
> * Use 没(有) for possession, existence, or completed past actions

### 3. Tone Change: 不 (bù → bú)

When 不 (bù) is followed by another 4th tone word, it changes to 2nd tone (bú) due to tone sandhi:

* 不是 (bú shì) - is not (because 是 shì is 4th tone)
* 不去 (bú qù) - don't go (because 去 qù is 4th tone)
* 不对 (bú duì) - not correct (because 对 duì is 4th tone)

But with other tones, 不 stays as 4th tone (bù):
* 不好 (bù hǎo) - not good (好 hǎo is 3rd tone)
* 不来 (bù lái) - not coming (来 lái is 2nd tone)
* 不能 (bù néng) - cannot (能 néng is 2nd tone)

### 4. Negating Adjectives

In Chinese, adjectives function like verbs, so they're negated the same way:

* 好 (hǎo) - good → 不好 (bù hǎo) - not good
* 忙 (máng) - busy → 不忙 (bù máng) - not busy
* 贵 (guì) - expensive → 不贵 (bú guì) - not expensive

Examples:
* 这本书不贵。(Zhè běn shū bú guì.) - This book is not expensive.
* 今天不冷。(Jīntiān bù lěng.) - Today is not cold.

### 5. Double Negation (Affirmative Meaning)

Unlike English, double negation in Chinese creates a weak affirmative:

* 不是不好 (Bú shì bù hǎo) - It's not that it's not good (= It's actually somewhat good)
* 他不是不去 (Tā bú shì bù qù) - It's not that he's not going (= He might go)

### 6. Special Negation Patterns

#### A. Negating 有 (yǒu)

Always use 没 instead of 不 to negate 有:
* CORRECT: 我没有钱。(Wǒ méi yǒu qián.) - I don't have money.
* INCORRECT: ~~我不有钱。(Wǒ bù yǒu qián.)~~

#### B. Negating Ability: 不会 (bú huì)

To say "cannot do" in the sense of not having the ability:
* 我不会说日语。(Wǒ bú huì shuō Rìyǔ.) - I cannot speak Japanese. (= I don't know how)
* 他不会游泳。(Tā bú huì yóuyǒng.) - He cannot swim. (= He doesn't know how)

#### C. Negating Possibility: 不能 (bù néng)

To say "cannot do" in the sense of not being allowed or possible:
* 你不能在这里吸烟。(Nǐ bù néng zài zhèlǐ xīyān.) - You cannot smoke here. (= It's not allowed)
* 我今天不能去。(Wǒ jīntiān bù néng qù.) - I cannot go today. (= It's not possible)

### 7. Negative Answers to Questions

When responding negatively to yes/no questions, Chinese typically repeats the verb in the negative form:

Question: 你喜欢中国菜吗？(Nǐ xǐhuān Zhōngguó cài ma?) - Do you like Chinese food?
Negative answer: 不喜欢。(Bù xǐhuān.) - No. (Literally: Don't like.)

Question: 你有时间吗？(Nǐ yǒu shíjiān ma?) - Do you have time?
Negative answer: 没有。(Méi yǒu.) - No. (Literally: Don't have.)

### 8. Universal Negation: "No one," "Nothing," etc.

Chinese often forms universal negation with 没有 + question word:

* 没有人 (méi yǒu rén) - no one, nobody
* 没有什么 (méi yǒu shénme) - nothing
* 没有地方 (méi yǒu dìfang) - nowhere
* 我没有看见任何人。(Wǒ méi yǒu kànjiàn rènhé rén.) - I didn't see anyone.

### Common Mistakes & Thinking Traps

*   **Using 不 with 有:** Using 不有 instead of 没有 to mean "don't have" or "there isn't".
*   **Using 不 for Past Actions:** Saying ~~我不去了学校~~ instead of 我没去学校 for "I didn't go to school".
*   **Misplacing the Negative:** Putting 不 or 没 after the verb instead of before it. The negative ALWAYS comes before the verb/adjective.
*   **Using Only 不 for Answering:** Just saying 不 instead of 不是, 不去, etc. This can sound incomplete or abrupt.
*   **Forgetting 没 with 有:** Using 不 with 有 is a common error, even for advanced learners!

### Quick Practice

1. I don't want to go.
2. This is not my book.
3. He doesn't like coffee.
4. I don't have time today.
5. She can't speak Japanese.
6. Don't eat this food.
