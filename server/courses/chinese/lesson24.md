## Lesson 24: Passive Voice with 被 (bèi)

Chinese, like English, has ways to express the passive voice - when the subject of the sentence receives the action rather than performs it. The most common way to form passive sentences is with the character 被 (bèi). Let's explore how this works!

### 1. Understanding the Passive Voice in Chinese

The passive voice shifts focus from who/what is performing an action to who/what is receiving it.

Compare:
* Active: 老师批评了学生。(Lǎoshī pīpíng le xuésheng.) - The teacher criticized the student.
* Passive: 学生被老师批评了。(Xuésheng bèi lǎoshī pīpíng le.) - The student was criticized by the teacher.

> **Thinking Point:** In the passive construction, the original object (student) becomes the subject, and the original subject (teacher) follows 被.

### 2. Basic Structure of 被 (bèi) Sentences

**Structure:** Subject (receiver) + 被 + Agent (doer) + Verb + Other elements

Examples:
* 鱼被猫吃了。(Yú bèi māo chī le.) - The fish was eaten by the cat.
* 窗户被风吹开了。(Chuānghu bèi fēng chuī kāi le.) - The window was blown open by the wind.
* 他被老板骂了。(Tā bèi lǎobǎn mà le.) - He was scolded by the boss.

### 3. Omitting the Agent

Sometimes, the agent (doer of the action) is unknown or unimportant and can be omitted:

**Structure:** Subject + 被 + Verb + Other elements

Examples:
* 我的钱包被偷了。(Wǒ de qiánbāo bèi tōu le.) - My wallet was stolen. (We don't know who stole it)
* 这封信被寄出去了。(Zhè fēng xìn bèi jì chū qù le.) - This letter has been sent out.
* 问题被解决了。(Wèntí bèi jiějué le.) - The problem has been solved.

### 4. Passive Voice with Result Complements

The 被 construction often includes result complements to show the outcome of the action:

Examples:
* 衣服被雨淋湿了。(Yīfu bèi yǔ lín shī le.) - The clothes were soaked by the rain.
* 玻璃被小孩打破了。(Bōli bèi xiǎohái dǎ pò le.) - The glass was broken by the child.
* 房子被大风吹倒了。(Fángzi bèi dà fēng chuī dǎo le.) - The house was blown down by the strong wind.

### 5. Alternative Passive Structures

Besides 被, other characters can indicate passive voice:

#### A. 让 (ràng) - by/to let

Used for less negative situations:

Examples:
* 我让雨淋湿了。(Wǒ ràng yǔ lín shī le.) - I was soaked by the rain.
* 她让朋友感动了。(Tā ràng péngyou gǎndòng le.) - She was moved by her friend.

#### B. 叫 (jiào) - by/to call

Similar to 让 but more colloquial:

Examples:
* 他叫狗咬了。(Tā jiào gǒu yǎo le.) - He was bitten by a dog.
* 我叫他骗了。(Wǒ jiào tā piàn le.) - I was deceived by him.

#### C. 给 (gěi) - by/to give

Often used in northern dialects:

Examples:
* 鱼给猫吃了。(Yú gěi māo chī le.) - The fish was eaten by the cat.
* 他给老板批评了。(Tā gěi lǎobǎn pīpíng le.) - He was criticized by the boss.

### 6. Expressing "Get/Got" with Passive Voice

The passive voice is often used to express the English "get/got" with negative experiences:

Examples:
* 他被警察抓住了。(Tā bèi jǐngchá zhuā zhù le.) - He got caught by the police.
* 我的自行车被偷了。(Wǒ de zìxíngchē bèi tōu le.) - My bicycle got stolen.
* 她被雨淋湿了。(Tā bèi yǔ lín shī le.) - She got soaked by the rain.

### 7. Negative Passive Sentences

To create a negative passive sentence, add 没 or 没有 before 被:

Examples:
* 这本书没被看过。(Zhè běn shū méi bèi kàn guò.) - This book hasn't been read.
* 窗户没被关上。(Chuānghu méi bèi guān shàng.) - The window hasn't been closed.

### 8. Cultural Note: Adversity in Passive Voice

In traditional Chinese usage, the 被 construction often carries a negative connotation, suggesting the subject suffered something unwanted. However, in modern Chinese, it's increasingly used for neutral or even positive situations as well:

Examples:
* Traditional negative use: 他被开除了。(Tā bèi kāichú le.) - He was fired.
* Modern neutral use: 她被选为班长。(Tā bèi xuǎn wéi bānzhǎng.) - She was elected class monitor.
* Modern positive use: 他被表扬了。(Tā bèi biǎoyáng le.) - He was praised.

### Common Mistakes & Thinking Traps

* **Incorrect Word Order:** Placing the agent after the verb instead of after 被.
* **Omitting Necessary Elements:** The result or outcome of the action is often required in a 被 sentence.
* **Using 被 with Any Verb:** Not all verbs work well with 被, especially state verbs or perception verbs like 喜欢 (xǐhuān) or 知道 (zhīdào).
* **Overusing Passive Voice:** Chinese tends to prefer active constructions more than English does.
