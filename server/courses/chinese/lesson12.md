## Lesson 12: Talking About Actions - Expressing Ongoing, Completed & Future Actions

In this lesson, we'll explore how Chinese expresses different aspects of actions: whether they are happening now, have been completed, or will happen in the future. Unlike many European languages, Chinese doesn't have tenses in the traditional sense but uses other markers to indicate time aspects.

### 1. Present Ongoing Actions: 在/正在 + Verb + 呢

To express an action happening right now (equivalent to English "-ing" form), Chinese uses 在 (zài) or 正在 (zhèngzài) before the verb, and often 呢 (ne) at the end:

**Structure:** Subject + 在/正在 + Verb + Object + (呢)

Examples:
* 我在学习。(Wǒ zài xuéxí.) - I am studying.
* 他正在看书。(Tā zhèngzài kàn shū.) - He is reading a book.
* 他们在吃饭呢。(Tāmen zài chīfàn ne.) - They are eating.
* 老师正在说话。(Lǎoshī zhèngzài shuōhuà.) - The teacher is speaking.

> **Thinking Point:** Unlike English, Chinese doesn't have a special verb form like "is eating." Instead, it uses "action markers" like 在 and 正在 to indicate ongoing action.

### 2. Completed Actions: Verb + 了

To indicate a completed action, Chinese uses the particle 了 (le) after the verb. This is somewhat like the past tense, but focuses on completion rather than just past time:

**Structure:** Subject + Verb + 了 + Object

Examples:
* 我吃了早饭。(Wǒ chī le zǎofàn.) - I ate breakfast. (I've completed eating breakfast)
* 他买了一本书。(Tā mǎi le yī běn shū.) - He bought a book.
* 我们看了一部电影。(Wǒmen kàn le yī bù diànyǐng.) - We watched a movie.

> **Context Clues:** The completed aspect (了) often implies past time, but the focus is on completion rather than when it happened. Context usually makes the time clear.

#### Using Time Words for Clarification

To make the time reference more explicit, you can add time words:

* 我**昨天**吃了早饭。(Wǒ **zuótiān** chī le zǎofàn.) - I ate breakfast **yesterday**.
* 他**刚才**买了一本书。(Tā **gāngcái** mǎi le yī běn shū.) - He **just** bought a book.
* 我们**上个星期**看了一部电影。(Wǒmen **shàng ge xīngqī** kàn le yī bù diànyǐng.) - We watched a movie **last week**.

### 3. Future Actions

Chinese has several ways to express future actions:

#### A. Using Time Words with Present Form

The simplest way is to use future time words with the verb in its present form:

**Structure:** Subject + Future Time Word + Verb + Object

Examples:
* 我明天去北京。(Wǒ míngtiān qù Běijīng.) - I will go to Beijing tomorrow.
* 下个月我学习中文。(Xià ge yuè wǒ xuéxí Zhōngwén.) - Next month I will study Chinese.

#### B. Using 要 (yào) or 会 (huì)

For more specific future intentions or predictions:

* 要 (yào) - going to, planning to (indicates intention)
* 会 (huì) - will (indicates probability or ability)

Examples:
* 我要去买东西。(Wǒ yào qù mǎi dōngxi.) - I'm going to go shopping.
* 明天会下雨。(Míngtiān huì xià yǔ.) - It will rain tomorrow.
* 我们要去中国。(Wǒmen yào qù Zhōngguó.) - We are going to go to China.
* 他会说中文。(Tā huì shuō Zhōngwén.) - He will/can speak Chinese.

> **Thinking Point:** 会 (huì) has two meanings: "will" (future) and "can" (ability). Context usually makes it clear which meaning is intended.

#### C. Using 将 (jiāng) or 将要 (jiāngyào)

These are more formal ways to express future actions:

* 我将参加会议。(Wǒ jiāng cānjiā huìyì.) - I will attend the meeting.
* 他将要毕业。(Tā jiāngyào bìyè.) - He is about to graduate.

### 4. Experience with 过 (guò)

To indicate that an action has been experienced in the past (similar to "have ever..."), Chinese uses 过 (guò):

**Structure:** Subject + Verb + 过 + Object

Examples:
* 我去过中国。(Wǒ qù guò Zhōngguó.) - I have been to China (before).
* 你吃过中国菜吗？(Nǐ chī guò Zhōngguó cài ma?) - Have you (ever) eaten Chinese food?
* 他没学过中文。(Tā méi xué guò Zhōngwén.) - He has never studied Chinese.

> **Distinction:** 了 (le) indicates completion, while 过 (guò) indicates experience. "我去了中国" means "I went to China" (focusing on the completed trip), while "我去过中国" means "I have been to China" (focusing on the experience).

### 5. Continuing Actions: 正在 + Verb + 着

For ongoing states or continuous actions:

**Structure:** Subject + (正在) + Verb + 着 + Object

Examples:
* 墙上挂着一幅画。(Qiáng shàng guà zhe yì fú huà.) - A painting is hanging on the wall.
* 他站着看书。(Tā zhàn zhe kàn shū.) - He is standing (while) reading a book.
* 门开着。(Mén kāi zhe.) - The door is open.

### 6. Immediate Future: 快要 (kuàiyào) or 就要 (jiùyào)

To express that something is about to happen:

**Structure:** Subject + 快要/就要 + Verb + Object

Examples:
* 电影快要开始了。(Diànyǐng kuàiyào kāishǐ le.) - The movie is about to start.
* 我就要毕业了。(Wǒ jiùyào bìyè le.) - I'm about to graduate.

### 7. Duration with 了

To indicate how long an action has been continuing:

**Structure:** Subject + Verb + Time Duration + 了

Examples:
* 我学中文学了三年了。(Wǒ xué Zhōngwén xué le sān nián le.) - I have been studying Chinese for three years.
* 他在北京住了五年了。(Tā zài Běijīng zhù le wǔ nián le.) - He has been living in Beijing for five years.

> **Note the double 了:** The first 了 follows the verb, and the second 了 comes at the end of the sentence.

### 8. Verb Complements: Verb + 完 (wán)

To indicate the completion of an action:

**Structure:** Subject + Verb + 完 + Object

Examples:
* 我吃完了饭。(Wǒ chī wán le fàn.) - I have finished eating.
* 他写完了作业。(Tā xiě wán le zuòyè.) - He has finished writing the homework.

### Common Mistakes & Thinking Traps

*   **Using 了 Like a Past Tense Marker:** Thinking of 了 as just "past tense" rather than a completion marker. Remember, 了 focuses on completion, not just past time.
*   **Confusing 过 and 了:** Using 了 when you want to express prior experience (应该用过).
*   **Placement of 了:** Putting 了 in the wrong position. It generally comes right after the verb or at the end of the sentence (for change of state).
*   **Forgetting to Use Time Words:** Relying only on aspect markers without clarifying time. Adding time words (yesterday, next week, etc.) helps make your meaning clearer.
*   **Misusing 在:** Using 在 for habitual actions rather than current ongoing actions.
