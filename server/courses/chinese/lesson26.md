## Lesson 26: Expressing Duration - How Long Something Takes/Lasts

Understanding how to express duration is essential for everyday communication. Chinese has several patterns for expressing how long actions or states last, and they differ from English in important ways.

### 1. Basic Duration Expressions

To express how long an action takes, Chinese places the duration after the verb:

**Structure:** Subject + Verb + Duration + Object

Examples:
* 我学了三年中文。(Wǒ xué le sān nián Zhōngwén.) - I studied Chinese for three years.
* 他睡了八个小时。(Tā shuì le bā gè xiǎoshí.) - He slept for eight hours.
* 我们等了两个小时。(Wǒmen děng le liǎng gè xiǎoshí.) - We waited for two hours.

> **Thinking Point:** Unlike English, which typically places duration expressions at the end of the sentence, Chinese often places them right after the verb.

### 2. Expressing "Spent Time Doing Something"

To emphasize the time spent doing something, Chinese has another pattern:

**Structure:** Subject + Verb + Duration + Verb Phrase

Examples:
* 我花了三个小时写作业。(Wǒ huā le sān gè xiǎoshí xiě zuòyè.) - I spent three hours doing homework.
* 他用了两天时间看完这本书。(Tā yòng le liǎng tiān shíjiān kàn wán zhè běn shū.) - He spent two days finishing this book.

### 3. Ongoing Duration with 了

To express how long something has been going on up to the present, Chinese uses a special pattern with two 了 particles:

**Structure:** Subject + Verb + 了 + Duration + 了

Examples:
* 我学中文学了三年了。(Wǒ xué Zhōngwén xué le sān nián le.) - I have been studying Chinese for three years (and still am).
* 他在北京住了五年了。(Tā zài Běijīng zhù le wǔ nián le.) - He has been living in Beijing for five years.
* 我们认识了十年了。(Wǒmen rènshi le shí nián le.) - We have known each other for ten years.

> **Thinking Point:** The first 了 follows the verb and marks the action, while the second 了 at the end indicates the continuing state up to now.

### 4. Duration with 有

Another way to express duration, especially for ongoing states, is with 有:

**Structure:** Subject + Verb + 有 + Duration + 了

Examples:
* 我学中文有三年了。(Wǒ xué Zhōngwén yǒu sān nián le.) - I have been studying Chinese for three years.
* 他在这家公司工作有十年了。(Tā zài zhè jiā gōngsī gōngzuò yǒu shí nián le.) - He has been working at this company for ten years.

### 5. Frequency Over Duration

To express how often something happens over a duration:

**Structure:** Subject + Time Period + Verb + Frequency

Examples:
* 我一天喝三杯咖啡。(Wǒ yì tiān hē sān bēi kāfēi.) - I drink three cups of coffee a day.
* 他一周去两次健身房。(Tā yí zhōu qù liǎng cì jiànshēnfáng.) - He goes to the gym twice a week.
* 我一个月看四本书。(Wǒ yí gè yuè kàn sì běn shū.) - I read four books a month.

### 6. Duration Until Completion

To express how long it takes to complete something:

**Structure:** Subject + Verb + Duration + 才 + Result/Completion

Examples:
* 我学了三年才会说中文。(Wǒ xué le sān nián cái huì shuō Zhōngwén.) - It took me three years to learn to speak Chinese.
* 他走了两个小时才到家。(Tā zǒu le liǎng gè xiǎoshí cái dào jiā.) - It took him two hours of walking to get home.
* 我等了一个小时，他才来。(Wǒ děng le yí gè xiǎoshí, tā cái lái.) - I waited for an hour before he came.

### 7. Specific Time Period with 来

To indicate the duration of a state until the present moment:

**Structure:** Subject + Duration + 来 + State

Examples:
* 这三年来我一直在北京。(Zhè sān nián lái wǒ yìzhí zài Běijīng.) - For these three years, I've been in Beijing the whole time.
* 最近几个月来她很忙。(Zuìjìn jǐ gè yuè lái tā hěn máng.) - She has been very busy these past few months.

### Common Mistakes & Thinking Traps

* **Putting Duration in the Wrong Position:** Placing duration at the end of the sentence as in English (~~我学习中文三年~~) instead of after the verb (我学习中文学了三年).
* **Forgetting Double 了 for Ongoing States:** Omitting either the first or second 了 in the pattern "verb + 了 + duration + 了".
* **Confusing 了 and 过:** Using 过 instead of 了 when talking about continuing states (过 is for completed experiences).
* **Omitting Measure Words:** Forgetting to use measure words with time units (e.g., 个 with 小时, 月, etc.).

### Quick Practice

4. We have known each other for ten years.
5. I work five days a week.
