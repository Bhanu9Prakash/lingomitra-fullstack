## Lesson 10: Describing Things - Adjectives & Adverbs

In Chinese, adjectives and adverbs work a bit differently than in English. Let's explore how to use them to describe people, objects, and actions.

### 1. Adjectives (形容词 - xíngróngcí)

In Chinese, adjectives function more like verbs! This means:
* They don't need a linking verb like "is" or "are"
* They typically need an adverb before them in simple sentences
* They can serve as the main predicate of a sentence

#### A. Adjectives as Predicates (without 是)

The typical structure for a simple descriptive sentence is:

**Subject + (Adverb) + Adjective**

Examples:
* 天气很热。(Tiānqì hěn rè.) - The weather is hot. (Literally: "Weather very hot")
* 这个问题很难。(Zhège wèntí hěn nán.) - This question is difficult.
* 那本书很贵。(Nà běn shū hěn guì.) - That book is expensive.

> **Thinking Point:** Notice there's no word for "is" or "are" in these sentences! The adjective itself functions as the main verb. Also, in normal statements, an adjective usually needs an adverb like 很 (hěn - very) before it.

#### B. The Role of 很 (hěn) and Degree Adverbs

In Chinese, simple adjective predicates typically require an adverb of degree. The most common is 很 (hěn), which literally means "very" but often functions simply as a link with no emphatic meaning:

* 我很忙。(Wǒ hěn máng.) - I am busy. (Not necessarily "very busy")
* 他很高。(Tā hěn gāo.) - He is tall.

Other common degree adverbs include:
* 非常 (fēicháng) - very, extremely
* 太 (tài) - too
* 真 (zhēn) - really
* 特别 (tèbié) - especially, particularly
* 比较 (bǐjiào) - relatively, quite

Examples:
* 这个电影非常好看。(Zhège diànyǐng fēicháng hǎokàn.) - This movie is extremely good.
* 那家餐厅太贵了。(Nà jiā cāntīng tài guì le.) - That restaurant is too expensive.
* 中文真有意思。(Zhōngwén zhēn yǒuyìsi.) - Chinese is really interesting.
* 今天特别冷。(Jīntiān tèbié lěng.) - Today is particularly cold.
* 这里比较安静。(Zhèlǐ bǐjiào ānjìng.) - This place is quite quiet.

> **Important Exception:** When asking questions or making comparisons, you can omit 很:
> * 你忙吗？(Nǐ máng ma?) - Are you busy?
> * 这本书贵吗？(Zhè běn shū guì ma?) - Is this book expensive?

#### C. Adjectives Before Nouns (Attributive Use)

When adjectives come before nouns (rather than acting as predicates), they need the particle 的 (de) in most cases:

**Structure:** Adjective + 的 + Noun

Examples:
* 贵的衣服 (guì de yīfu) - expensive clothes
* 好的老师 (hǎo de lǎoshī) - good teacher
* 漂亮的花 (piàoliang de huā) - beautiful flowers

**Exception:** Single-syllable adjectives modifying single-syllable nouns often omit 的:
* 红花 (hóng huā) - red flower
* 大山 (dà shān) - big mountain
* 好人 (hǎo rén) - good person

### 2. Comparisons

#### A. Basic Comparison with 比 (bǐ)

To make comparisons, Chinese uses 比 (bǐ) which means "compared to":

**Structure:** A + 比 + B + Adjective

Examples:
* 我比他高。(Wǒ bǐ tā gāo.) - I am taller than him. (Literally: "I compared-to him tall")
* 这本书比那本书贵。(Zhè běn shū bǐ nà běn shū guì.) - This book is more expensive than that book.
* 今天比昨天冷。(Jīntiān bǐ zuótiān lěng.) - Today is colder than yesterday.

> **Thinking Point:** Notice how simple Chinese comparisons are! No need for "more" or "less" before the adjective - just the adjective itself is sufficient after the 比 structure.

#### B. Equality with 和...一样 (hé...yíyàng)

To express that things are the same or equal:

**Structure:** A + 和 + B + 一样 + Adjective

Examples:
* 我和他一样高。(Wǒ hé tā yíyàng gāo.) - I am as tall as him.
* 这本书和那本书一样贵。(Zhè běn shū hé nà běn shū yíyàng guì.) - This book is as expensive as that book.

#### C. Expressing "Less Than" with 没有

To express that something is less than something else:

**Structure:** A + 没有 + B + Adjective

Examples:
* 我没有他高。(Wǒ méiyǒu tā gāo.) - I am not as tall as him. (I am shorter than him)
* 这本书没有那本书贵。(Zhè běn shū méiyǒu nà běn shū guì.) - This book is less expensive than that book.

### 3. Adverbs (副词 - fùcí)

Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. In Chinese, they always come before the word they modify.

#### A. Position of Adverbs

The general position of adverbs is:

**Subject + Time Adverb + Manner Adverb + Verb/Adjective**

Common adverbs:
* 也 (yě) - also, too
* 都 (dōu) - all, both
* 只 (zhǐ) - only
* 还 (hái) - still, yet
* 已经 (yǐjīng) - already
* 常常/经常 (chángcháng/jīngcháng) - often
* 很少 (hěn shǎo) - seldom
* 总是 (zǒngshì) - always
* 马上 (mǎshàng) - right away
* 慢慢 (mànmàn) - slowly

Examples:
* 他也喜欢中文。(Tā yě xǐhuān Zhōngwén.) - He also likes Chinese.
* 我们都去过北京。(Wǒmen dōu qù guò Běijīng.) - We have all been to Beijing.
* 她只吃蔬菜。(Tā zhǐ chī shūcài.) - She only eats vegetables.
* 我还在学习。(Wǒ hái zài xuéxí.) - I am still studying.
* 他已经回家了。(Tā yǐjīng huí jiā le.) - He has already gone home.
* 我经常去那家餐厅。(Wǒ jīngcháng qù nà jiā cāntīng.) - I often go to that restaurant.

#### B. Negation with Adverbs

Negative adverbs like 不 (bù) and 没 (méi) always come before the verb or adjective:
* 我不常常去那里。(Wǒ bù chángcháng qù nàlǐ.) - I don't often go there.
* 他没已经吃饭。(Tā méi yǐjīng chīfàn.) - He hasn't already eaten.

### 4. Reduplication for Emphasis

A special feature of Chinese adjectives and adverbs is reduplication for emphasis or to express a softer quality:

**A. Adjective Reduplication: AA**
* 高 (gāo - tall) → 高高 (gāogāo - very tall/quite tall)
* 大 (dà - big) → 大大 (dàdà - very big)
* 红 (hóng - red) → 红红 (hónghóng - very red)

**B. Two-Syllable Adjective Reduplication: AABB**
* 漂亮 (piàoliang - beautiful) → 漂漂亮亮 (piàopiàoliàngliàng - very beautiful)
* 干净 (gānjìng - clean) → 干干净净 (gāngānjiàjiàng - very clean)

**C. Adverb Reduplication:**
* 慢 (màn - slow) → 慢慢 (mànmàn - slowly)
* 快 (kuài - fast) → 快快 (kuàikuài - quickly)

Example:
* 小朋友高高兴兴地回家了。(Xiǎopéngyǒu gāogāoxìngxìng de huí jiā le.) - The children went home very happily.

### Common Mistakes & Thinking Traps

*   **Using 是 with Adjectives:** Saying ~~他是高~~ instead of 他很高 for "he is tall." Remember, simple adjectives don't need 是!
*   **Omitting 很:** Saying ~~我忙~~ instead of 我很忙 for "I am busy." In simple statements, adjectives typically need an adverb like 很.
*   **Wrong Word Order:** Putting adverbs after the words they modify. Adverbs ALWAYS come before the words they modify.
*   **Comparison Mistakes:** Adding extra words like "more" in comparisons (~~我比他更高~~ is redundant; just say 我比他高).
*   **Forgetting 的 with Attributive Adjectives:** Forgetting to add 的 when using multi-syllable adjectives before nouns.
