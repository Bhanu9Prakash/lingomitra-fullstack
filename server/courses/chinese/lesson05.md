## Lesson 5: Saying Hello & Goodbye - Chinese Greetings (问候语)

Greetings are your entry point into any conversation! Chinese has different greetings depending on the situation, time of day, and level of formality. Let's learn the most common ones.

### Basic Hellos

| Chinese | Pinyin      | Literal Meaning | Usage Notes                                     |
|---------|-------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 你好    | Nǐ hǎo      | You good       | Standard greeting, equivalent to "hello", works in most situations |
| 您好    | Nín hǎo     | You (formal) good | More formal or respectful version, used with elders, teachers, or people of higher status |
| 大家好  | Dàjiā hǎo   | Everyone good  | Group greeting, addressing multiple people      |
| 早上好  | Zǎoshang hǎo | Morning good   | Good morning (early morning)                   |
| 早      | Zǎo         | Early          | Short for "good morning" (very casual)         |
| 下午好  | Xiàwǔ hǎo    | Afternoon good | Good afternoon                                 |
| 晚上好  | Wǎnshang hǎo | Evening good   | Good evening                                   |

> **Thinking Point:** Note that Chinese greetings often contain the character 好 (hǎo - good), and many time-related greetings follow the pattern "[Time] + 好". Also, the greeting "nǐ hǎo" uses the third tone + third tone combination, so it's actually pronounced "ní hǎo" in practice (the first third tone changes to second tone).

### Saying Goodbye

| Chinese  | Pinyin      | Literal Meaning | Usage Notes                                  |
|----------|-------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 再见    | Zàijiàn     | See again      | Standard goodbye, like "bye" or "see you"   |
| 明天见  | Míngtiān jiàn | Tomorrow see   | See you tomorrow                            |
| 回头见  | Huítóu jiàn  | Turn-around see | See you later/in a bit                      |
| 拜拜    | Bāibāi       | Bye-bye        | Casual goodbye (borrowed from English)      |

> **Thinking Point:** Many Chinese farewells use the verb 见 (jiàn - to see), similar to English "see you" expressions.

### Cultural Notes on Chinese Greetings

1. **Physical Greetings:** Handshakes are common in formal settings, but traditional Chinese greetings involve limited physical contact. Bowing was traditionally practiced but is less common in modern China.

2. **Content Questions as Greetings:** Chinese people often greet with practical questions like "Have you eaten?" (你吃了吗？- Nǐ chī le ma?) or "Where are you going?" (你去哪儿？- Nǐ qù nǎr?). These aren't intrusive - they're just friendly conversation starters.

3. **Formality:** Chinese has different levels of formality. Note the distinction between 你好 (Nǐ hǎo - informal) and 您好 (Nín hǎo - formal). Using the formal "您" shows respect to elders or people of higher status.

4. **Context-Based Greetings:** Like in many cultures, Chinese greetings often relate to the time of day or specific situations.

### Common Mistakes & Thinking Traps

*   **Pronunciation of "Nǐ hǎo":** Due to tone changes when two third tones occur together, "Nǐ hǎo" is actually pronounced "Ní hǎo" (second tone + third tone).
*   **Overusing "Nǐ hǎo":** While it works in most situations, it's not always what locals use. Context-specific greetings (like time-based ones) often sound more natural.
*   **Literal Interpretation:** Responding to "Have you eaten?" (你吃了吗？) with a detailed answer about your meal. It's more of a greeting than an actual inquiry about food!
*   **Missing the Formal/Informal Distinction:** Using 你好 (Nǐ hǎo) when 您好 (Nín hǎo) would be more appropriate for elders or authority figures.

### Quick Practice
