## Lesson 17: Chinese Sentence Structure - Basic Patterns & Word Order

Understanding sentence structure is crucial for communicating in any language. In this lesson, we'll explore the basic patterns of Chinese sentences, focusing on word order and variations.

### 1. Basic Chinese Sentence Order: Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)

Like English, the most common Chinese sentence structure is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO):

**Structure:** Subject + Verb + Object

Examples:
* 我吃饭。(Wǒ chīfàn.) - I eat rice/food.
* 他看书。(Tā kàn shū.) - He reads books.
* 老师教中文。(Lǎoshī jiāo Zhōngwén.) - The teacher teaches Chinese.

> **Thinking Point:** This basic structure is the foundation for most Chinese sentences and is similar to English word order.

### 2. Topic-Comment Structure

Chinese is also a topic-prominent language, which means it often begins sentences with the topic (what the sentence is about), followed by a comment (what is said about the topic):

**Structure:** Topic + Comment

Examples:
* 中国菜，我很喜欢。(Zhōngguó cài, wǒ hěn xǐhuān.) - Chinese food, I like it very much.
* 那本书，我已经看完了。(Nà běn shū, wǒ yǐjīng kàn wán le.) - That book, I have already finished reading it.
* 昨天的考试，大家都觉得很难。(Zuótiān de kǎoshì, dàjiā dōu juéde hěn nán.) - Yesterday's exam, everyone thought it was very difficult.

> **Thinking Point:** The topic-comment structure allows for more flexibility in emphasizing what the sentence is about.

### 3. Subject-Verb Sentences (Without Object)

Some Chinese verbs don't require an object:

**Structure:** Subject + Verb

Examples:
* 他笑了。(Tā xiào le.) - He smiled/laughed.
* 雨停了。(Yǔ tíng le.) - The rain has stopped.
* 孩子们在玩。(Háizi men zài wán.) - The children are playing.

### 4. Subject + Adjective Sentences (Without 是)

Remember that Chinese often uses adjectives as predicates without need for a linking verb like "is":

**Structure:** Subject + (很/非常/太...) + Adjective

Examples:
* 天气很热。(Tiānqì hěn rè.) - The weather is hot.
* 这个问题太难了。(Zhège wèntí tài nán le.) - This problem is too difficult.
* 她非常漂亮。(Tā fēicháng piàoliang.) - She is very beautiful.

### 5. Sentences with 是 (shì - to be)

The verb 是 (shì) is used to equate one noun with another:

**Structure:** Subject + 是 + Noun/Noun Phrase

Examples:
* 我是学生。(Wǒ shì xuésheng.) - I am a student.
* 这是我的书。(Zhè shì wǒ de shū.) - This is my book.
* 明天是星期五。(Míngtiān shì xīngqī wǔ.) - Tomorrow is Friday.

### 6. Sentences with 有 (yǒu - to have)

The verb 有 (yǒu) expresses possession or existence:

**Structure:** Subject + 有 + Object

Examples:
* 我有一本书。(Wǒ yǒu yì běn shū.) - I have a book.
* 教室里有二十个学生。(Jiàoshì lǐ yǒu èrshí gè xuésheng.) - There are twenty students in the classroom.
* 桌子上有什么？(Zhuōzi shàng yǒu shénme?) - What is on the table?

### 7. Time and Place Words in Chinese Sentences

Unlike English, Chinese typically places time expressions before place expressions:

**Structure:** Subject + Time + Place + Verb + Object

Examples:
* 我明天在家学习。(Wǒ míngtiān zài jiā xuéxí.) - I will study at home tomorrow.
* 他每天在公司工作。(Tā měitiān zài gōngsī gōngzuò.) - He works at the company every day.
* 我们昨天在饭馆吃饭了。(Wǒmen zuótiān zài fànguǎn chīfàn le.) - We ate at the restaurant yesterday.

> **Memory Aid:** "TIME comes before PLACE" - this is the opposite of English, which typically puts place before time ("at school yesterday" vs. "yesterday at school").

### 8. Question Patterns

#### A. Yes/No Questions

As we learned in Lesson 6, yes/no questions can be formed by:

1. Adding 吗 (ma) to a statement:
   * 你是学生。 -> 你是学生吗？(Nǐ shì xuésheng ma?) - Are you a student?

2. Using the V-not-V pattern:
   * 你是不是学生？(Nǐ shì bú shì xuésheng?) - Are you a student?
   * 你有没有车？(Nǐ yǒu méi yǒu chē?) - Do you have a car?

#### B. Wh-Questions

Chinese keeps question words (what, who, when, where, why, how) in the same position as the answer would be:

* 你叫什么名字？(Nǐ jiào shénme míngzi?) - What is your name? (Lit: "You called what name?")
* 你什么时候来？(Nǐ shénme shíhou lái?) - When are you coming?
* 他为什么不来？(Tā wèishénme bù lái?) - Why isn't he coming?

### 9. Sentences with Adverbs

Adverbs in Chinese usually come before the verb they modify:

**Structure:** Subject + Adverb + Verb + Object

Examples:
* 我经常喝咖啡。(Wǒ jīngcháng hē kāfēi.) - I often drink coffee.
* 他很快地跑了。(Tā hěn kuài de pǎo le.) - He ran very quickly.
* 老师已经来了。(Lǎoshī yǐjīng lái le.) - The teacher has already come.

> **Note:** The particle 地 (de) is often used between an adverb and verb when the adverb is a phrase rather than a single word.

### 10. The "Ba" Construction for Manipulated Objects

The 把 (bǎ) construction is used when the object is manipulated or affected in some way:

**Structure:** Subject + 把 + Object + Verb + Complement

Examples:
* 我把书放在桌子上。(Wǒ bǎ shū fàng zài zhuōzi shàng.) - I put the book on the table.
* 他把饭吃完了。(Tā bǎ fàn chī wán le.) - He finished eating the food.
* 老师把门关上了。(Lǎoshī bǎ mén guān shàng le.) - The teacher closed the door.

> **Thinking Point:** The 把 construction emphasizes what happens to the object, and is typically used when the verb has a result or direction complement.

### 11. Expressing "There is/are" with Location + 有

To say there is something at a location, Chinese typically puts the location first:

**Structure:** Location + 有 + Subject

Examples:
* 桌子上有一本书。(Zhuōzi shàng yǒu yì běn shū.) - There is a book on the table.
* 教室里有学生。(Jiàoshì lǐ yǒu xuésheng.) - There are students in the classroom.
* 冰箱里没有牛奶。(Bīngxiāng lǐ méiyǒu niúnǎi.) - There is no milk in the refrigerator.

### Common Mistakes & Thinking Traps

*   **Putting Place Before Time:** Saying ~~我在家明天学习~~ instead of 我明天在家学习. Remember, time comes before place in Chinese.
*   **Using 是 with Adjectives:** Saying ~~天气是热~~ instead of 天气很热 or ~~我是高~~ instead of 我很高. Adjectives in Chinese typically don't need a linking verb.
*   **Incorrect Word Order with Question Words:** Placing question words at the beginning of sentences as in English, like ~~什么你想吃？~~ instead of 你想吃什么？
*   **Forgetting Measure Words:** Saying ~~我有一书~~ instead of 我有一本书.
*   **Topic-Comment Confusion:** Overusing the topic-comment structure in contexts where standard SVO would be more natural.

### Quick Practice

Translate these sentences into Chinese, focusing on correct sentence structure:

1. I study Chinese every day.
2. He is a teacher.
3. There is a cat under the table.
4. I will go to the store tomorrow.
5. This book is very interesting.
