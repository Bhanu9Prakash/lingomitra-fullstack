## Lesson 21: Expressing Past Experiences with 过 (guò)

While we briefly touched on 过 (guò) in Lesson 12, let's explore this important grammar pattern more deeply. The experiential marker 过 helps you talk about things you've done before or experiences you've had in your life.

### 1. Understanding 过 (guò) vs. 了 (le)

Both 过 and 了 can relate to past actions, but they have different focuses:

* **了 (le)**: Indicates completion of an action (often, but not always, in the past)
* **过 (guò)**: Indicates that an action has been experienced at least once before

Compare these examples:
* 我去了北京。(Wǒ qù le Běijīng.) - I went to Beijing. (Focus on the completed trip)
* 我去过北京。(Wǒ qù guò Běijīng.) - I have been to Beijing (before). (Focus on having had the experience)

> **Thinking Point:** Think of 了 as "done" and 过 as "been there, done that." The focus of 了 is on completion, while 过 emphasizes the experience itself.

### 2. Basic Structure of 过 (guò)

**Structure:** Subject + Verb + 过 + Object

Examples:
* 你吃过寿司吗？(Nǐ chī guò shòusī ma?) - Have you (ever) eaten sushi?
* 我看过这部电影。(Wǒ kàn guò zhè bù diànyǐng.) - I have seen this movie before.
* 他学过日语。(Tā xué guò Rìyǔ.) - He has studied Japanese before.

### 3. Using 过 (guò) with Time Expressions

When using 过 with specific time expressions, we're usually referring to something that was experienced during that time:

Examples:
* 我去年去过中国。(Wǒ qùnián qù guò Zhōngguó.) - I went to China last year. (I had the experience last year)
* 他小时候学过钢琴。(Tā xiǎo shíhou xué guò gāngqín.) - He learned piano when he was young. (He had the experience)

### 4. Negating 过 (guò) with 没 (méi)

To express that you haven't experienced something, use 没 (méi) before the verb and 过 after it:

**Structure:** Subject + 没 + Verb + 过 + Object

Examples:
* 我没去过美国。(Wǒ méi qù guò Měiguó.) - I have never been to America.
* 他没吃过中国菜。(Tā méi chī guò Zhōngguó cài.) - He has never eaten Chinese food.
* 你没看过这本书吗？(Nǐ méi kàn guò zhè běn shū ma?) - Haven't you read this book before?

> **Thinking Point:** Note that we do not use 不 (bù) to negate 过, only 没.

### 5. Asking Questions with 过 (guò)

To ask if someone has experienced something, add 吗 (ma) at the end of the sentence:

**Structure:** Subject + Verb + 过 + Object + 吗?

Examples:
* 你去过中国吗？(Nǐ qù guò Zhōngguó ma?) - Have you been to China?
* 你见过名人吗？(Nǐ jiàn guò míngrén ma?) - Have you ever met a celebrity?
* 你吃过臭豆腐吗？(Nǐ chī guò chòu dòufu ma?) - Have you ever eaten stinky tofu?

### 6. Common Expressions with 过 (guò)

* 经历过 (jīnglì guò) - to have experienced
* 听说过 (tīngshuō guò) - to have heard of
* 用过 (yòng guò) - to have used before
* 见过面 (jiàn guò miàn) - to have met before
* 去过 (qù guò) - to have been to
* 试过 (shì guò) - to have tried before

Examples:
* 我听说过这个故事。(Wǒ tīngshuō guò zhège gùshi.) - I have heard of this story.
* 我们以前见过面。(Wǒmen yǐqián jiàn guò miàn.) - We have met before.

### 7. 过 (guò) vs. 了 (le) in Action

Let's explore the subtle differences between these two particles through more examples:

* **Learning Chinese:**
  * 我昨天学了中文。(Wǒ zuótiān xué le Zhōngwén.) - I studied Chinese yesterday. (Emphasis on the completed action)
  * 我学过中文。(Wǒ xué guò Zhōngwén.) - I have studied Chinese before. (I have experience with it)

* **Visiting a Place:**
  * 我上周去了上海。(Wǒ shàng zhōu qù le Shànghǎi.) - I went to Shanghai last week. (The trip happened and was completed)
  * 我去过上海三次。(Wǒ qù guò Shànghǎi sān cì.) - I have been to Shanghai three times. (I have had the experience three times)

### Common Mistakes & Thinking Traps

* **Confusing 了 and 过:** Using 了 when you want to express an experience, or using 过 when you just want to indicate completion.
* **Using 过 for Ongoing Experiences:** Using 过 for something you're still doing—it's for experiences that are completed (though they may be repeated).
* **Negating with 不 Instead of 没:** Saying ~~不去过~~ instead of 没去过 for "have not been to."
* **Omitting 过 in Questions About Experience:** Asking ~~你去中国吗？~~ instead of 你去过中国吗？ when you mean "Have you ever been to China?"

### Quick Practice

Translate these sentences into Chinese, paying attention to the difference between 了 and 过:

1. Have you ever eaten Japanese food?
2. I have never seen that movie.
3. She went to the store yesterday.
4. Have you been to Beijing before?
5. I have read this book twice.
6. She has never used a computer.
7. We visited the museum last week.
8. Have you heard of this song?
