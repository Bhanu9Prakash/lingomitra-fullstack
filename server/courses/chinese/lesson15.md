## Lesson 15: Making Comparisons - "More Than" & "Less Than"

Comparing things is a fundamental part of communication. In this lesson, we'll explore the various ways Chinese expresses comparisons, including "more than," "less than," "as...as," superlatives, and more.

### 1. Basic Comparisons with 比 (bǐ)

The most common way to make comparisons in Chinese is with the word 比 (bǐ), which means "compared to":

**Structure:** A + 比 + B + Adjective

Examples:
* 我比他高。(Wǒ bǐ tā gāo.) - I am taller than him. (Literally: "I compared to him tall")
* 中文比英文难。(Zhōngwén bǐ Yīngwén nán.) - Chinese is harder than English.
* 北京比上海大。(Běijīng bǐ Shànghǎi dà.) - Beijing is bigger than Shanghai.

> **Thinking Point:** Unlike English, Chinese does not need words like "more" or "-er" with the adjective. The 比 structure itself indicates the comparison.

#### Adding Specific Measurements

To specify by how much something is more/less:

**Structure:** A + 比 + B + Adjective + Specific Amount

Examples:
* 我比他高五厘米。(Wǒ bǐ tā gāo wǔ límǐ.) - I am 5 centimeters taller than him.
* 这本书比那本书贵十块钱。(Zhè běn shū bǐ nà běn shū guì shí kuài qián.) - This book is 10 yuan more expensive than that book.

### 2. Expressing "Less Than" with 没有/不如

There are two main ways to say something is "less than" something else:

#### A. Using 没有 (méiyǒu)

**Structure:** A + 没有 + B + Adjective

Examples:
* 我没有他高。(Wǒ méiyǒu tā gāo.) - I am not as tall as him. (I am shorter than him)
* 今天没有昨天热。(Jīntiān méiyǒu zuótiān rè.) - Today is not as hot as yesterday.

#### B. Using 不如 (bùrú)

**Structure:** A + 不如 + B + Adjective

Examples:
* 我不如他高。(Wǒ bùrú tā gāo.) - I am not as tall as him.
* 这部电影不如那部电影有意思。(Zhè bù diànyǐng bùrú nà bù diànyǐng yǒuyìsi.) - This movie is not as interesting as that movie.

> **Nuance:** 不如 often implies not just "less than" but "inferior to" or "not as good as."

### 3. Expressing Equality with 和...一样

To say things are the same or equal:

**Structure:** A + 和/跟 + B + 一样 + Adjective

Examples:
* 我和他一样高。(Wǒ hé tā yíyàng gāo.) - I am as tall as him.
* 今天和昨天一样热。(Jīntiān hé zuótiān yíyàng rè.) - Today is as hot as yesterday.
* 这个苹果跟那个苹果一样大。(Zhège píngguǒ gēn nàge píngguǒ yíyàng dà.) - This apple is as big as that apple.

> **Note:** Both 和 (hé) and 跟 (gēn) can be used in this structure with similar meaning.

### 4. Expressing Superlatives

To express "the most," Chinese uses 最 (zuì) before the adjective:

**Structure:** 最 + Adjective + (的) + Noun

Examples:
* 这是最好的餐厅。(Zhè shì zuì hǎo de cāntīng.) - This is the best restaurant.
* 他是班里最高的学生。(Tā shì bān lǐ zuì gāo de xuésheng.) - He is the tallest student in the class.
* 中国是世界上最大的国家之一。(Zhōngguó shì shìjiè shàng zuì dà de guójiā zhī yī.) - China is one of the largest countries in the world.

### 5. Expressing "More and More"

To express increasing intensity:

**Structure:** 越来越 (yuè lái yuè) + Adjective

Examples:
* 天气越来越热。(Tiānqì yuè lái yuè rè.) - The weather is getting hotter and hotter.
* 中文越来越难。(Zhōngwén yuè lái yuè nán.) - Chinese is becoming more and more difficult.
* 他的汉语越来越好。(Tā de Hànyǔ yuè lái yuè hǎo.) - His Chinese is getting better and better.

### 6. The Progressive Comparison: "The more..., the more..."

This structure uses 越 (yuè) twice:

**Structure:** 越 + Adjective/Verb 1 + 越 + Adjective/Verb 2

Examples:
* 我越学越喜欢。(Wǒ yuè xué yuè xǐhuān.) - The more I study, the more I like it.
* 他越说越快。(Tā yuè shuō yuè kuài.) - The more he speaks, the faster he gets.
* 这本书越读越有意思。(Zhè běn shū yuè dú yuè yǒuyìsi.) - The more I read this book, the more interesting it becomes.

### 7. Comparing Verbs

To compare actions (rather than qualities), Chinese uses similar structures:

#### A. Ability comparison with 比

**Structure:** A + 比 + B + Verb + 得 + Adjective

Examples:
* 我比他说中文说得好。(Wǒ bǐ tā shuō Zhōngwén shuō de hǎo.) - I speak Chinese better than him.
* 他比我游泳游得快。(Tā bǐ wǒ yóuyǒng yóu de kuài.) - He swims faster than I do.

#### B. Frequency comparison

**Structure:** A + 比 + B + Time Adverb + Verb

Examples:
* 我比他常常去图书馆。(Wǒ bǐ tā chángcháng qù túshūguǎn.) - I go to the library more often than him.
* 他比我早起床。(Tā bǐ wǒ zǎo qǐchuáng.) - He gets up earlier than I do.

### 8. Other Comparison Structures

#### A. "A is better than B" with 比...好

**Structure:** A + 比 + B + 好

Examples:
* 这家餐厅比那家餐厅好。(Zhè jiā cāntīng bǐ nà jiā cāntīng hǎo.) - This restaurant is better than that restaurant.
* 今天的天气比昨天好。(Jīntiān de tiānqì bǐ zuótiān hǎo.) - Today's weather is better than yesterday's.

#### B. Preferring A over B with 比较喜欢

**Structure:** 比较喜欢 + A + 而不是 + B

Examples:
* 我比较喜欢咖啡而不是茶。(Wǒ bǐjiào xǐhuān kāfēi ér bùshì chá.) - I prefer coffee rather than tea.
* 她比较喜欢看书而不是看电视。(Tā bǐjiào xǐhuān kàn shū ér bùshì kàn diànshì.) - She prefers reading books rather than watching TV.

### Common Mistakes & Thinking Traps

*   **Adding Words Like "More" to Adjectives:** In Chinese, you don't need to add anything to the adjective in a 比 structure. Saying ~~我比他更高~~ or ~~我比他多高~~ is redundant; just say 我比他高.
*   **Wrong Word Order:** Putting the adjective before 比, as in ~~高比他~~ instead of 比他高.
*   **Confusing 和...一样 and 比:** Using 和...一样 when you mean "more than" or 比 when you mean "the same as."
*   **Using 比 with Negation Incorrectly:** Saying ~~我比他不高~~ to mean "I'm not as tall as him." The correct forms are 我没有他高 or 我不如他高.
*   **Forgetting to Repeat the Verb:** In verb comparisons, forgetting to repeat the verb after the object: ~~我比他中文说得好~~ instead of 我比他说中文说得好.
