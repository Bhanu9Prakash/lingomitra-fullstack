## Lesson 25: Reduplication Patterns in Chinese

Reduplication is a fascinating and common feature in Chinese that involves repeating characters to create new meanings or grammatical effects. In this lesson, we'll explore the various reduplication patterns and their uses.

### 1. What is Reduplication?

Reduplication refers to the repetition of a character or syllable to create a new word or modify its meaning. It can affect verbs, adjectives, measure words, and nouns, each with different effects.

> **Thinking Point:** In English, we sometimes repeat words for emphasis ("very very good"), but Chinese has systematic patterns of reduplication that affect meaning in specific ways.

### 2. Verb Reduplication: Action Briefly or Lightly Done

Verb reduplication generally indicates doing something a little bit, briefly, or trying something:

**Structure:** V + V (single-syllable verbs) or V + One + V (two-syllable verbs)

Examples with single-syllable verbs:
* 看 (kàn) → 看看 (kànkan) - take a look
* 听 (tīng) → 听听 (tīngtīng) - listen for a bit
* 试 (shì) → 试试 (shìshi) - try it out
* 走 (zǒu) → 走走 (zǒuzou) - take a walk

Examples with two-syllable verbs:
* 讨论 (tǎolùn) → 讨论一讨论 (tǎolùn yi tǎolùn) - discuss a bit
* 考虑 (kǎolǜ) → 考虑一考虑 (kǎolǜ yi kǎolǜ) - think it over a bit

Examples in sentences:
* 我们坐坐吧。(Wǒmen zuò zuò ba.) - Let's sit for a while.
* 你尝尝这个菜。(Nǐ cháng chang zhège cài.) - Try this dish a bit.
* 我想休息休息。(Wǒ xiǎng xiūxi xiūxi.) - I want to rest for a bit.

### 3. Adjective Reduplication: Intensification

When adjectives are reduplicated, they often create a more vivid or intensive quality:

#### A. Single-syllable adjectives: AA pattern

Examples:
* 红 (hóng) → 红红 (hónghóng) - very red/reddish
* 大 (dà) → 大大 (dàdà) - very big
* 高 (gāo) → 高高 (gāogāo) - very tall
* 新 (xīn) → 新新 (xīnxīn) - brand new

#### B. Two-syllable adjectives: AABB pattern

Examples:
* 漂亮 (piàoliang) → 漂漂亮亮 (piàopiàoliàngliàng) - very beautiful
* 干净 (gānjìng) → 干干净净 (gāngānjìngjìng) - spotlessly clean
* 高兴 (gāoxìng) → 高高兴兴 (gāogāoxìngxìng) - very happy
* 清楚 (qīngchu) → 清清楚楚 (qīngqīngchǔchǔ) - very clear/clearly

Examples in sentences:
* 他穿着干干净净的衣服。(Tā chuānzhe gāngānjìngjìng de yīfu.) - He's wearing spotlessly clean clothes.
* 小朋友高高兴兴地回家了。(Xiǎopéngyou gāogāoxìngxìng de huí jiā le.) - The children went home very happily.

### 4. Measure Word Reduplication: "Every"

Reduplicating measure words creates a distributive meaning, similar to "every":

**Structure:** MW + MW

Examples:
* 个个 (gège) - each and every one
* 天天 (tiāntiān) - every day
* 年年 (niánnián) - every year
* 次次 (cìcì) - every time

Examples in sentences:
* 件件事情都很重要。(Jiànjiàn shìqing dōu hěn zhòngyào.) - Each and every matter is important.
* 他天天学习。(Tā tiāntiān xuéxí.) - He studies every day.
* 次次考试他都得第一名。(Cìcì kǎoshì tā dōu dé dì yī míng.) - Every time there's an exam, he gets first place.

### 5. Noun Reduplication: Familiarity or Affection

Some nouns can be reduplicated to show familiarity, affection, or informality:

Examples:
* 妈 (mā) → 妈妈 (māma) - mom
* 爸 (bà) → 爸爸 (bàba) - dad
* 姐 (jiě) → 姐姐 (jiějie) - older sister
* 哥 (gē) → 哥哥 (gēge) - older brother

### 6. Special Reduplication Patterns

#### A. ABB Pattern (Adjective intensifiers):

Examples:
* 白花花 (bái huāhuā) - dazzlingly white
* 红通通 (hóng tōngtōng) - bright red
* 绿油油 (lǜ yōuyōu) - lush green
* 黑乎乎 (hēi hūhū) - pitch black

Examples in sentences:
* 田野绿油油的。(Tiányě lǜ yōuyōu de.) - The fields are lush green.
* 他的脸红通通的。(Tā de liǎn hóng tōngtōng de.) - His face is bright red.

#### B. ABAB Pattern (Reduplicated two-syllable words):

Examples:
* 研究研究 (yánjiū yánjiū) - study a bit
* 商量商量 (shāngliang shāngliang) - discuss a bit
* 思考思考 (sīkǎo sīkǎo) - think it over

### 7. Tone Changes in Reduplication

In many cases of reduplication, the second syllable changes to a neutral tone:

Examples:
* 看 (kàn, 4th tone) → 看看 (kàn kan, 4th tone + neutral)
* 妈 (mā, 1st tone) → 妈妈 (mā ma, 1st tone + neutral)
* 听 (tīng, 1st tone) → 听听 (tīng ting, 1st tone + neutral)

> **Exception:** For adjectives in the AA pattern, both syllables usually keep their original tone.

### Common Mistakes & Thinking Traps

* **Inappropriate Reduplication:** Not all words can be reduplicated. Pay attention to common usage.
* **Forgetting Structure Particles:** After verb reduplication, any objects usually come after the full reduplicated form (看看书, not ~~看书看~~).
* **Incorrect Pattern for Two-Syllable Words:** Using AA pattern instead of AABB for two-syllable adjectives or forgetting to add 一 between reduplicated two-syllable verbs.
* **Misunderstanding the Meaning:** Thinking verb reduplication means doing something repeatedly, when it often means doing something briefly or lightly.

### Quick Practice

Form the reduplicated version of these words and create a sentence with each:

1. 看 (kàn) - to look
2. 漂亮 (piàoliang) - beautiful
3. 年 (nián) - year
4. 试 (shì) - to try
5. 干净 (gānjìng) - clean
6. 次 (cì) - time (occurrence)
7. 走 (zǒu) - to walk
8. 高兴 (gāoxìng) - happy
