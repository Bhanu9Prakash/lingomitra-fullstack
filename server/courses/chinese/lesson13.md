## Lesson 13: Making Requests & Giving Commands - Imperatives

In daily conversations, we often need to ask people to do things or give instructions. Let's explore how to make requests, give commands, and offer suggestions in Chinese.

### 1. Basic Imperative Form

The simplest way to give a command in Chinese is to use just the verb (and object if needed):

**Structure:** Verb + Object

Examples:
* 坐！(Zuò!) - Sit!
* 看这里！(Kàn zhèlǐ!) - Look here!
* 说中文！(Shuō Zhōngwén!) - Speak Chinese!

> **Cultural Note:** This direct form can sound abrupt or impolite in many contexts. It's mainly used in emergency situations, with very close friends/family, or when giving instructions to subordinates.

### 2. Polite Commands with 请 (qǐng)

Adding 请 (qǐng - please) makes commands more polite:

**Structure:** 请 + Verb + Object

Examples:
* 请坐。(Qǐng zuò.) - Please sit.
* 请看这里。(Qǐng kàn zhèlǐ.) - Please look here.
* 请告诉我。(Qǐng gàosu wǒ.) - Please tell me.
* 请等一下。(Qǐng děng yíxià.) - Please wait a moment.

> **Cultural Note:** This is the standard polite way to give commands in most situations.

### 3. Softened Commands with 吧 (ba)

Adding the particle 吧 (ba) at the end softens a command into a suggestion:

**Structure:** Verb + Object + 吧

Examples:
* 走吧。(Zǒu ba.) - Let's go.
* 吃饭吧。(Chīfàn ba.) - Let's eat.
* 休息一下吧。(Xiūxi yíxià ba.) - Take a rest.
* 试试看吧。(Shì shi kàn ba.) - Give it a try.

> **Thinking Point:** Adding 吧 turns a direct command into a gentler suggestion, similar to "why don't you..." or "let's..." in English.

### 4. Negative Commands with 不要 (búyào) or 别 (bié)

To tell someone NOT to do something:

**Structure:** 不要/别 + Verb + Object

Examples:
* 不要动！(Búyào dòng!) - Don't move!
* 别说话！(Bié shuōhuà!) - Don't talk!
* 请不要吸烟。(Qǐng búyào xīyān.) - Please don't smoke.
* 别担心。(Bié dānxīn.) - Don't worry.

> **Nuance:** 不要 (búyào) is slightly more formal, while 别 (bié) is more colloquial.

### 5. Giving Options with 可以 (kěyǐ)

Using 可以 (kěyǐ - can/may) allows you to make a suggestion while giving the listener a choice:

**Structure:** 你/您 + 可以 + Verb + Object

Examples:
* 你可以坐这里。(Nǐ kěyǐ zuò zhèlǐ.) - You can sit here.
* 您可以先填表。(Nín kěyǐ xiān tián biǎo.) - You can fill out the form first.
* 你可以用中文说。(Nǐ kěyǐ yòng Zhōngwén shuō.) - You can speak in Chinese.

### 6. Giving Advice with 应该 (yīnggāi)

For giving advice or saying what someone should do:

**Structure:** 你/您 + 应该 + Verb + Object

Examples:
* 你应该多休息。(Nǐ yīnggāi duō xiūxi.) - You should rest more.
* 我们应该早点去。(Wǒmen yīnggāi zǎodiǎn qù.) - We should go earlier.
* 你不应该这么说。(Nǐ bù yīnggāi zhème shuō.) - You shouldn't say that.

### 7. Making Requests with 能 (néng) or 可以 (kěyǐ)

For polite requests asking if someone can do something:

**Structure:** 你/您 + 能/可以 + Verb + Object + 吗?

Examples:
* 你能帮我一下吗？(Nǐ néng bāng wǒ yíxià ma?) - Can you help me?
* 您可以给我看一下吗？(Nín kěyǐ gěi wǒ kàn yíxià ma?) - Can you show me?
* 能给我打个电话吗？(Néng gěi wǒ dǎ ge diànhuà ma?) - Can you give me a call?

> **Thinking Point:** Questions using 能/可以 are among the most common ways to make polite requests in Chinese, similar to "Could you..." in English.

### 8. Suggestions with 让我们 (ràng wǒmen)

For making suggestions that include the speaker:

**Structure:** 让我们 + Verb + Object

Examples:
* 让我们开始吧。(Ràng wǒmen kāishǐ ba.) - Let's begin.
* 让我们一起去吧。(Ràng wǒmen yìqǐ qù ba.) - Let's go together.

### 9. Pattern for "Help me do something" with 帮 (bāng)

**Structure:** 帮 + Person + Verb + Object

Examples:
* 帮我拿一下。(Bāng wǒ ná yíxià.) - Help me take this.
* 请帮我开门。(Qǐng bāng wǒ kāi mén.) - Please help me open the door.
* 能帮我翻译一下吗？(Néng bāng wǒ fānyì yíxià ma?) - Can you help me translate this?

### 10. Adding 一下 (yíxià) to Soften Commands

The phrase 一下 (yíxià) literally means "one time" or "a bit," but it's often added to requests to make them sound more casual and less demanding:

Examples:
* 等一下。(Děng yíxià.) - Wait a moment.
* 看一下这个。(Kàn yíxià zhège.) - Take a look at this.
* 请再说一下。(Qǐng zài shuō yíxià.) - Please say it again.

### Common Mistakes & Thinking Traps

*   **Being Too Direct:** Using the bare verb form (坐!) in situations that call for more politeness. In most contexts, adding 请 or using question forms with 可以/能 is more appropriate.
*   **Forgetting 吗 in Questions:** When making a request with 能/可以, forgetting to add the question particle 吗 at the end.
*   **Wrong Word Order:** Placing 不要/别 after the verb rather than before it (e.g., ~~"去不要"~~ instead of "不要去").
*   **Confusing 让 and 请:** Using 让 (to let/allow) when you mean 请 (please).
*   **Excessive Politeness:** In some informal situations among friends, being too formal can sound unnatural.
