## Lesson 3: Counting in Chinese - Numbers (数字 Shùzì) & Basic Quantities

Counting is essential! Let's learn the Chinese number system (`数字` - *shùzì*). You'll find that Chinese has a beautifully logical counting system, unlike English with its irregular "eleven," "twelve," etc.

### The Basics: Numbers 0-10

These first numbers need to be memorized, but they're simple and form the foundation for all larger numbers.

| Number | Chinese | Pinyin     | Pronunciation Hint                                |
|--------|---------|------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 0      | **零**  | **líng**   | *ling* (2nd tone) - like "ling" with rising tone    |
| 1      | **一**  | **yī**     | *ee* (1st tone) - like "ee" with high level tone    |
| 2      | **二**  | **èr**     | *ar* (4th tone) - like "are" with falling tone      |
| 3      | **三**  | **sān**    | *sahn* (1st tone) - like "sahn" with level tone     |
| 4      | **四**  | **sì**     | *suh* (4th tone) - like "suh" with falling tone     |
| 5      | **五**  | **wǔ**     | *woo* (3rd tone) - like "woo" with dipping tone     |
| 6      | **六**  | **liù**    | *lyoh* (4th tone) - like "lee-oh" quickly with falling tone |
| 7      | **七**  | **qī**     | *chee* (1st tone) - like "chee" with level tone     |
| 8      | **八**  | **bā**     | *bah* (1st tone) - like "bah" with level tone       |
| 9      | **九**  | **jiǔ**    | *jyoh* (3rd tone) - like "jee-oh" with dipping tone |
| 10     | **十**  | **shí**    | *shir* (2nd tone) - like "sure" with rising tone    |

> **Thinking Point: Lucky and Unlucky Numbers**
> In Chinese culture, number 8 (`bā`) is lucky because it sounds similar to `fā` (发) which means "prosperity." Number 4 (`sì`) is considered unlucky because it sounds like `sǐ` (死) which means "death." Many buildings in China skip floor numbers containing 4!

### Building Numbers 11-99: The Logical Pattern

Chinese numbers are remarkably logical! Once you know 1-10, you can easily form larger numbers.

**11-19: "Ten + X"**
* 11 = 十一 (shí yī) - literally "ten one"
* 12 = 十二 (shí èr) - literally "ten two"
* 13 = 十三 (shí sān) - literally "ten three"
* ...and so on.

**20-99: "X Ten + Y"**
* 20 = 二十 (èr shí) - literally "two ten"
* 21 = 二十一 (èr shí yī) - literally "two ten one"
* 30 = 三十 (sān shí) - literally "three ten"
* 35 = 三十五 (sān shí wǔ) - literally "three ten five"
* 99 = 九十九 (jiǔ shí jiǔ) - literally "nine ten nine"

> **Language Transfer Intuition:** Compare this to English, which has irregular forms like "eleven," "twelve," "twenty," "thirty." Chinese simply uses the base numbers combined consistently. For example, 35 is literally "three ten five" (三十五), very logical!

### Larger Numbers: Hundreds, Thousands, & Beyond

Chinese counting continues its logical pattern with larger place values:

* 100 = 一百 (yì bǎi) - literally "one hundred"
* 1,000 = 一千 (yì qiān) - literally "one thousand"
* 10,000 = 一万 (yì wàn) - literally "one ten-thousand"
* 100,000,000 = 一亿 (yì yì) - literally "one hundred-million"

**Important note:** Chinese groups numbers by ten-thousands (万), not thousands. So large numbers are thought of differently:
* 50,000 = 五万 (wǔ wàn) - "five ten-thousands"
* 1,000,000 = 一百万 (yì bǎi wàn) - "one hundred ten-thousands"

### Combining These Larger Units:

* 101 = 一百零一 (yì bǎi líng yī) - "one hundred zero one"
* 110 = 一百一十 (yì bǎi yī shí) - "one hundred one ten"
* 234 = 二百三十四 (èr bǎi sān shí sì) - "two hundred three ten four"
* 2,358 = 两千三百五十八 (liǎng qiān sān bǎi wǔ shí bā) - "two thousand three hundred five ten eight"

> **Special Note: 二 (èr) vs. 两 (liǎng)**
> There are two words for "two" in Chinese:
> * `èr` (二) is used for counting, in telephone numbers, and other abstract contexts
> * `liǎng` (两) is used when referring to two of something, especially with measure words

### Special Uses for Numbers:

**Phone Numbers:** Usually read as a series of single digits:
* Phone number 13812345678 = 一三八一二三四五六七八 (yī sān bā yī èr sān sì wǔ liù qī bā)

**Ordinal Numbers:** Add 第 (dì) before the number:
* First = 第一 (dì yī)
* Second = 第二 (dì èr)
* Third = 第三 (dì sān)

**Money:** The Chinese currency is 元 (yuán) or informal 块 (kuài):
* 5 yuan = 五元 (wǔ yuán) or 五块 (wǔ kuài)
* 10.5 yuan = 十元五角 (shí yuán wǔ jiǎo) or 十块五 (shí kuài wǔ)

### Measure Words: Counting Objects

Chinese requires measure words between numbers and objects, similar to saying "two pieces of paper" or "three cups of water" in English, but used for all nouns.

Some common measure words:

| Measure Word | Pinyin | Used For                             | Example                                                |
|--------------|--------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 个           | gè     | General all-purpose measure word     | 三个人 (sān gè rén) - three people                     |
| 本           | běn    | Books, magazines                     | 两本书 (liǎng běn shū) - two books                     |
| 张           | zhāng  | Flat objects (paper, tables, etc.)   | 一张纸 (yì zhāng zhǐ) - a piece of paper               |
| 只           | zhī    | Animals, hands, ears                 | 两只猫 (liǎng zhī māo) - two cats                      |
| 杯           | bēi    | Cups (of drinks)                     | 一杯咖啡 (yì bēi kāfēi) - a cup of coffee             |
| 瓶           | píng   | Bottles                              | 三瓶水 (sān píng shuǐ) - three bottles of water        |

> **Thinking Point:** Measure words are like built-in "counters" in Chinese. While English has some such classifiers (a piece of paper, a head of cattle), Chinese uses them much more extensively. The basic pattern is:
> **Number + Measure Word + Noun**

### Common Mistakes & Thinking Traps

*   **Forgetting Zero:** When a place value is skipped, you need to insert 零 (líng). Example: 101 is 一百零一 (yì bǎi líng yī), not ~~一百一~~.
*   **Measure Word Confusion:** Forgetting to use measure words. You cannot say ~~"三书"~~ for "three books" - you must say 三本书 (sān běn shū).
*   **Mixing up 二 (èr) and 两 (liǎng):** Using 二 when 两 is required with measure words: ~~二个苹果~~ should be 两个苹果 (liǎng gè píngguǒ) for "two apples".
*   **Grouping Numbers Incorrectly:** Thinking in thousands instead of ten-thousands for large numbers.

### Quick Practice: Think it Through!

Convert these numbers to Chinese:

1.  15
2.  47
3.  82
4.  100
5.  250
6.  1,984
7.  10,500
8.  Third (ordinal)

Now try these phrases with measure words:
9.  Three people (人 rén = people)
10. Two cups of tea (茶 chá = tea)

*(Pause and try to convert them yourself before checking!)*

***Practice Answers:***

1.  *十五 (shí wǔ)*
2.  *四十七 (sì shí qī)*
3.  *八十二 (bā shí èr)*
4.  *一百 (yì bǎi)*
5.  *二百五十 (èr bǎi wǔ shí)*
6.  *一千九百八十四 (yì qiān jiǔ bǎi bā shí sì)*

8.  *第三 (dì sān)*
9.  *三个人 (sān gè rén)*
10. *两杯茶 (liǎng bēi chá)*

Great job working through these numbers! Having a solid grasp of numbers will enable you to talk about time, money, quantities, and more in everyday situations.
