## Lesson 16: Talking About Ability - "Can," "Could," "Able To"

Expressing what you or others can or cannot do is essential in daily communication. In this lesson, we'll explore the different ways Chinese expresses ability, permission, possibility, and skill.

### 1. Using 会 (huì) - Ability Through Learning or Skill

The word 会 (huì) is used to express an ability that is typically acquired through learning:

**Structure:** Subject + 会 + Verb + Object

Examples:
* 我会说中文。(Wǒ huì shuō Zhōngwén.) - I can speak Chinese.
* 他会游泳。(Tā huì yóuyǒng.) - He can swim.
* 你会开车吗？(Nǐ huì kāi chē ma?) - Can you drive?
* 我不会做菜。(Wǒ bú huì zuò cài.) - I cannot cook.

> **Thinking Point:** 会 refers to a learned skill or knowledge. It's about knowing *how* to do something.

### 2. Using 能 (néng) - Physical Ability or Circumstantial Possibility

The word 能 (néng) refers to being able to do something due to physical capability or external circumstances:

**Structure:** Subject + 能 + Verb + Object

Examples:
* 我今天能来。(Wǒ jīntiān néng lái.) - I can come today. (I'm able to, circumstances allow)
* 你能帮我一下吗？(Nǐ néng bāng wǒ yíxià ma?) - Can you help me a bit?
* 他生病了，不能去上班。(Tā shēngbìng le, bù néng qù shàngbān.) - He's sick and can't go to work.
* 这里能停车吗？(Zhèlǐ néng tíngchē ma?) - Can one park here? (Is it possible to park here?)

> **Thinking Point:** 能 is about possibility or ability in a specific situation, not necessarily about knowledge or skill.

### 3. Using 可以 (kěyǐ) - Permission or General Possibility

The word 可以 (kěyǐ) indicates permission or general acceptability:

**Structure:** Subject + 可以 + Verb + Object

Examples:
* 你可以坐这里。(Nǐ kěyǐ zuò zhèlǐ.) - You may/can sit here.
* 我们可以明天去吗？(Wǒmen kěyǐ míngtiān qù ma?) - Can we go tomorrow? (Is it allowed/possible?)
* 这里不可以抽烟。(Zhèlǐ bù kěyǐ chōuyān.) - Smoking is not allowed here.
* 可以用中文说吗？(Kěyǐ yòng Zhōngwén shuō ma?) - May I speak in Chinese?

> **Thinking Point:** 可以 often involves permission or what is allowable/acceptable, though it can also indicate general possibility.

### 4. The Differences Between 会, 能, and 可以

While there is some overlap, these words have distinct primary meanings:

* **会 (huì)** - Knowing how to do something (acquired skill)
* **能 (néng)** - Being able to do something (physical ability or circumstantial possibility)
* **可以 (kěyǐ)** - Being allowed to do something (permission or acceptability)

Compare these examples:
* 我会游泳，但是今天不能游泳，因为游泳池不可以用。
* (Wǒ huì yóuyǒng, dànshì jīntiān bù néng yóuyǒng, yīnwèi yóuyǒngchí bù kěyǐ yòng.)
* I know how to swim (skill), but I can't swim today (circumstantial inability), because the swimming pool cannot be used (not allowed/available).

### 5. Expressing Ability with Potential Complements (V + 得/不 + Complement)

Another way to express ability in Chinese is through potential complements, which indicate whether something can be done to completion or to a certain degree:

**Structure for "Can":** Verb + 得 + Result Complement
**Structure for "Cannot":** Verb + 不 + Result Complement

Examples:
* 我听得懂中文。(Wǒ tīng de dǒng Zhōngwén.) - I can understand Chinese. (Literally: "I listen and understand")
* 他听不懂英文。(Tā tīng bù dǒng Yīngwén.) - He cannot understand English.
* 这个箱子搬得动。(Zhège xiāngzi bān de dòng.) - This box can be moved. (It's movable)
* 这个箱子太重了，搬不动。(Zhège xiāngzi tài zhòng le, bān bù dòng.) - This box is too heavy, (I) can't move it.

Common verb-complement pairs:
* 听懂 (tīng dǒng) - to listen and understand
* 看见 (kàn jiàn) - to see clearly
* 吃完 (chī wán) - to finish eating
* 搬动 (bān dòng) - to move something
* 说清楚 (shuō qīngchu) - to speak clearly

### 6. Ability with 会 (huì) in the Past, Present, and Future

Unlike many European languages, 会 (huì) itself remains the same regardless of time reference:

**Past ability:**
* 我小时候会弹钢琴。(Wǒ xiǎo shíhou huì tán gāngqín.) - I could play piano when I was young.

**Present ability:**
* 我现在会开车。(Wǒ xiànzài huì kāi chē.) - I can drive now.

**Future ability:**
* 下个月我会说中文。(Xià ge yuè wǒ huì shuō Zhōngwén.) - Next month I will be able to speak Chinese.

> **Thinking Point:** Time words and context make the time reference clear without changing the form of 会.

### 7. Using 会 (huì) for Future Prediction

Beyond ability, 会 is also used to express future probability:

Examples:
* 明天会下雨。(Míngtiān huì xià yǔ.) - It will rain tomorrow.
* 他会来吗？(Tā huì lái ma?) - Will he come?
* 我想他不会迟到。(Wǒ xiǎng tā bú huì chídào.) - I think he won't be late.

> **Context is Key:** The meaning of 会 (ability vs. future) is determined by context. Verbs of skill (speak, play instruments, swim) tend to trigger the "ability" meaning, while natural phenomena and predictions tend to trigger the "future" meaning.

### 8. Expressing "Can" with Modal Adverbs

Some adverbs can also express possibility:

#### A. 也许/可能 (yěxǔ/kěnéng) - maybe, perhaps

* 他也许会来。(Tā yěxǔ huì lái.) - He might come.
* 他可能不会来。(Tā kěnéng bú huì lái.) - He probably won't come.

#### B. 一定 (yídìng) - certainly, definitely

* 他一定会来。(Tā yídìng huì lái.) - He will definitely come.

### Common Mistakes & Thinking Traps

*   **Confusing 会, 能, and 可以:** Using 会 when you mean permission (should use 可以) or using 能 when you mean skill (should use 会).
*   **Forgetting That 会 Has Two Meanings:** Not recognizing when 会 means "will" rather than "can."
*   **Incorrect Negation:** Saying ~~不得~~ instead of 不 in potential complements (e.g., ~~听得不懂~~ instead of 听不懂).
*   **Mixing Up Time References:** Trying to change the form of 会/能/可以 for different time periods instead of using time words.
*   **Word Order with Potential Complements:** Putting 得/不 in the wrong position (it goes between the verb and the result complement).

### Quick Practice

Translate these ability-related sentences into Chinese:

1. I can speak Chinese.
2. He can't come tomorrow.
3. May I open the window?
4. She can't understand what I'm saying.
5. I could swim when I was a child.
6. This problem can be solved.
7. You will be able to do it next time.
8. He might arrive late.
