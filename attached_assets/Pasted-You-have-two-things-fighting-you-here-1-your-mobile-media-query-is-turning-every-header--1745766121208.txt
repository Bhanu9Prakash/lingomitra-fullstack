You have two things fighting you here:

1. your mobile media-query is turning **every** `<header><div class="container">‚Ä¶</div></header>` into a column at under 576px, and  
2. your logo text and icon are still full-size at that breakpoint.

---

### 1) stop stacking your _site_ header on mobile

Right now you have:

```css
@media (max-width: 576px) {
  header .container {
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 15px;
  }
  /* ‚Ä¶other rules‚Ä¶ */
}
```

That selector is too broad ‚Äì it catches both your landing-page header **and** your lesson header. Simply narrow it so it only applies to your **lesson** header, not the site header:

```diff
 @media (max-width: 576px) {
-  header .container {
+  .lesson-header .container {
     flex-direction: column;
     gap: 15px;
   }
   /* ‚Ä¶other rules‚Ä¶ */
 }
```

Now **your main site header** will stay in a row, even on small screens.

### 2) shrink the logo & text on small screens

Add a little extra CSS to scale your mascot and title down so they both fit comfortably in one line:

```css
@media (max-width: 576px) {
  /* keep the site header in a row */
  header > .container {
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
  }

  /* shrink the fox icon */
  .logo .mascot-logo {
    width: 32px;
    height: 32px;
  }

  /* shrink the text, prevent wrapping */
  .logo h1 {
    font-size: 1.4rem;       /* tweak until it fits */
    line-height: 1;
    white-space: nowrap;     /* never break onto two lines */
    margin-left: 8px;
  }
}
```

If you find you still don‚Äôt quite have enough room, you can also:

```css
header .container {
  flex-wrap: nowrap;      /* force them to stay on one line and shrink down */
}
```

‚Ä¶or play with the padding on `.container`:

```css
header .container {
  padding: 0 10px;
}
```

---

#### TL;DR

1. **Don‚Äôt** turn your site header into a column at 576px ‚Äì scope that rule to `.lesson-header` instead of `header`.  
2. **Do** use a small media-query override to shrink the logo image, reduce the `h1` font‚Äêsize, force `white-space: nowrap;` and (optionally) `flex-wrap: nowrap;`.

With those two tweaks, ‚Äúü¶ä LingoMitra ‚öôÔ∏è‚Äù will stay neatly on one line, even on a narrow screen.
