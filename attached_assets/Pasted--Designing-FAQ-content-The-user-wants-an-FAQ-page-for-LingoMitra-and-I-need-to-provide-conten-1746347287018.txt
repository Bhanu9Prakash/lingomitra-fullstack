**Designing FAQ content**

The user wants an FAQ page for LingoMitra, and I need to provide content and a design layout. The FAQ should be structured with questions and answers. They are using Next.js and Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components. I should suggest an accordion-style FAQ section using shadcn/ui's "Accordion" or "Collapsible" component. I should avoid em dashes as previously requested and use simple hyphens instead. I'll focus on clear, beginner-friendly explanations, and I don't need to include images here.

**Designing FAQ structure**

The user wants help with both design and content for the FAQ page. Since they didn’t explicitly ask for a code file or canvas, I think it’s best to share a suggested FAQ structure directly in the chat. I’ll provide about 8-10 question-answer pairs, along with design suggestions for the layout, using an accordion component from shadcn/ui. I’ll also include a React code snippet for the layout, avoiding using tables since that's not necessary for this case.


Thought for 16 seconds


Below is a ready-to-ship FAQ page package for **LingoMitra**.
It covers three parts:

1. **UX layout blueprint** – how the page should feel and flow.
2. **Copy deck** – crisp questions and answers you can paste into the site.
3. **React + Tailwind component** – a drop-in page using shadcn/ui `Accordion`.

## 1. UX layout blueprint

```

Design hints:

* **Width** – max-w-2xl for text for comfy reading.
* **Spacing** – `space-y-4` between accordion items and a generous `py-24` around the hero.
* **Iconography** – preload a small SVG question mark for the hero, use chevrons in accordions.
* **SEO** – wrap each `<AccordionItem>` in a `<section>` with `itemProp="mainEntity"` microdata.

## 2. Copy deck

> Copy avoids em dashes and keeps sentences short for quick scanning.

### GENERAL

**What is LingoMitra?**
LingoMitra is a chat-based tutor that uses large language models to teach you how to *think* in a new language. It follows the Thinking Method, which means you answer first, then the AI helps you correct yourself.

**Which languages are available today?**
German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Kannada, Japanese and Chinese. More languages are on the roadmap and you can vote inside the app.

**Do I need to know English?**
Lessons are written in English for now. We plan to add full Telugu and Hindi interfaces soon.

### PRICING

**Is it free?**
The first two lessons in every language are free forever. After that you can unlock the full course with the Pro plan.

**How much is Pro?**
Pro is ₹799 per year. That gives you unlimited lessons, offline caching and priority support.

**Can I cancel any time?**
Yes. Go to Settings → Subscription → Cancel. You keep access until the renewal date.

### FEATURES

**How is LingoMitra different from Duolingo or Memrise?**
We focus on guided discovery not flashcards. Every lesson is a live conversation where the tutor adapts after each sentence you produce.

**Can I speak instead of type?**
Yes. Tap the mic icon to enable speech. The app transcribes locally, sends only the text to the AI, then speaks the reply back.

**Will it work offline?**
If you install the app as a PWA you can cache favourite lessons and review them without a connection. Speaking features need internet.

**Does it support streaks and progress tracking?**
A streak calendar and per-language progress bars motivate you. You can also reset or hide streaks if you prefer zero-pressure learning.

### PRIVACY AND SECURITY

**Are my chats private?**
Chats are encrypted in transit and at rest. We never sell or share your data.

**How do I delete my data?**
Open Settings → Privacy → Delete account. This wipes all messages, streaks and subscription info within 24 hours.

**Who can I contact for support?**
Use the in-app chat or email [hello@lingomitra.com](mailto:hello@lingomitra.com). We reply within one business day.

    </div>
  );
}
```

**Usage**

1. Save as `app/(public)/faq/page.tsx` (or wherever your routing expects).
2. Ensure `Accordion` and `Button` are exported from shadcn/ui.
3. Adjust prices, feature names or email address as needed.

With microcopy tuned for clarity and the accordion keeping scroll length short, this FAQ page should resolve most objections and let the support team focus on edge cases.
