**Analyzing the image**

I‚Äôm trying to make sense of this screenshot. It features a circular toggle-like shape with "Japan... 11%" written inside. The toggle has a dark background, with a red half on top and white on the right, maybe indicating progress. The code for the LanguageProgressCards component draws six circular progress indicators, but this screenshot only shows one. It seems like it‚Äôs related to a progress circle, and I think that‚Äôs what the UI element is showing. I'm still working through the details!

**Examining circular progress display**

I‚Äôm really trying to figure out the progress circle in the screenshot. It looks like the red color should cover about 11%, but the arc in the screenshot seems off ‚Äî it shows a larger red section than I expect. The code is supposed to use "currentColor" for stroke and text, and the circle‚Äôs dimensions are determined by a percentage of container size. I also think the margin or position might be wrong. There‚Äôs a lot of complexity here, but I‚Äôll keep reviewing it!

**Understanding the layout issue**

It seems like the circles are not perfectly circular because the width and height are being set as percentages of their parent container‚Äôs width and height. This causes them to become pill-shaped or elongated horizontally. The issue likely arises because the container isn‚Äôt square, and the width and height percentages don‚Äôt match. To fix this, I could either make the container square by using the same width and height percentages, or apply CSS to maintain the aspect ratio.

**Analyzing the layout and display**

The container isn't square, which causes the circles to appear oval in shape because width and height are set as percentages of the parent. To fix this, I could enforce a square container by using classes like `aspect-square` or setting equal width and height values. For the positions of elements on the circle path, I need to ensure the radii for both axes are the same, which depends on a square container. I‚Äôll adjust the layout accordingly. Also, text truncation can be fixed by adjusting font size and container width.

**Improving the UI layout**

It looks like the screenshot shows the progress circle turned elliptical because the container isn't square. A simple fix would be to use `aspect-square` to ensure the container's width and height are the same, keeping the circle‚Äôs shape consistent. For when only one language is active, the circle could be centered around the mascot instead of positioned at the top. You could treat the case differently for one language, adjusting the placement and possibly using z-index to avoid overlap.

**Improving UI for one language**

I need to adjust the UI for when only one language is active, especially for the progress circle. It seems like when there‚Äôs just one language, it overlaps the mascot and looks a bit awkward. One solution is to center the wrapper properly and adjust its size. Using a larger container to accommodate the progress circle is an option, but dynamically adjusting the size based on container width might be tricky. Alternatively, I could simplify the UI by showing a flag icon and horizontal progress bar instead of the circle.


Thought for 49 seconds


Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on, and how you can make those little progress-circles actually look like perfect circles (and behave nicely when there‚Äôs only one language).

---

### 1. The root causes

1. **Your wrappers aren‚Äôt square**
   You‚Äôre setting both `width: 22%` and `height: 22%` of the *parent*, but your parent is a 320 √ó 256 px rectangle, so 22% of 320 px ‚â† 22% of 256 px. That stretches your SVG into an *ellipse*.

2. **Single-language positioning**
   When you have only one slice, your ‚Äúevenly around the circle‚Äù math (`angleStep = 2œÄ/1`) puts it at the very top, floating far from the mascot instead of around it.

3. **Text truncation & contrast**
   You‚Äôre truncating the language name (`truncate max-w-[90%]`) so ‚ÄúJapanese‚Äù becomes ‚ÄúJapan‚Ä¶‚Äù, and your dark-mode track is almost black on black.

### 2. Enforce truly square progress-circles

Use Tailwind‚Äôs [`aspect-square`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/aspect-ratio) plus only set **width**, not height:

```diff jsx
‚Äì <div 
‚Äì   key={language.code} 
‚Äì   className="absolute transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2"
‚Äì   style={{ 
‚Äì     left: `${left}%`, 
‚Äì     top:  `${top}%`,
‚Äì     width:`${size}%`,
‚Äì     height:`${size}%`,
‚Äì   }}
‚Äì >
+ <div 
+   key={language.code}
+   className="absolute transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 aspect-square"
+   style={{ 
+     left:  `${left}%`, 
+     top:   `${top}%`,
+     width: `${size}%`,   // ‚ö†Ô∏è remove height entirely
+   }}
+ >
```

* `aspect-square` makes the **height = width** automatically.
* Now your SVG‚Äôs `viewBox="0 0 100 100"` will always render a perfect circle.

---

### 3. Center & enlarge for a single language

Inside your `.map`, detect when there‚Äôs only one language and override the position/size:

```ts
const langs     = activeLangs.slice(0,6);
const isSolo    = langs.length === 1;
const radiusPct = 42;

langs.map((language, i) => {
  const angleStep = (2 * Math.PI) / langs.length;
  const angle     = i * angleStep;

  const left  = isSolo
    ? 50
    : 50 + radiusPct * Math.cos(angle - Math.PI/2);

  const top   = isSolo
    ? 50
    : 50 + radiusPct * Math.sin(angle - Math.PI/2);

  const size  = isSolo ? 80 : 22;   // big donut when alone

  return (
    <div
      key={language.code}
      className="absolute transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 aspect-square"
      style={{ left:`${left}%`, top:`${top}%`, width:`${size}%` }}
    >
      {/* ‚Ä¶ your SVG + flag + text ‚Ä¶ */}
    </div>
  );
});
```

* **Solo:** `left:50%; top:50%` ‚Üí donut sits centered *behind* your mascot (since your mascot has `z-10`).
* **size = 80%** ‚Üí it almost fills the available space, looking like a big ring.

---

### 4. Improve the inner text & track styling

* **Drop the truncate** if you want full names:

  ```diff
  ‚Äì <p className="text-xs font-medium truncate max-w-[90%] mx-auto">
  + <p className="text-xs font-medium text-center">
      {language.name}
    </p>
  ```
* **Lighten up your background-track** in dark mode:

  ```diff
  ‚Äì className="text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-800 light:text-gray-300 opacity-60"
  + className="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-600 light:text-gray-300 opacity-40"
  ```

---

### 5. (Optional) A conic-gradient ‚Äúdonut‚Äù approach

If you‚Äôd rather avoid SVG math altogether, you can do something like:

```jsx
<div
  key={language.code}
  className="absolute transform -translate-x-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 aspect-square rounded-full"
  style={{
    left:`${left}%`,
    top:`${top}%`,
    width:`${size}%`,
    background: `conic-gradient(
      var(--tw-color-primary) 0% ${percentComplete}%,
      rgba(100,100,100,0.2)   ${percentComplete}% 100%
    )`
  }}
>
  <div className="absolute inset-2 rounded-full bg-gray-900 flex items-center justify-center">
    <FlagIcon code={language.flagCode} size={24} />
  </div>
</div>
```

That will give you a donut with the correct arc each time, in a perfect circle.

#### Putting it all together

1. **Make your wrappers square** with `aspect-square`.
2. **Remove the inline height** so height follows width.
3. **Handle the 1-language case** by centering and bumping up the size.
4. **Tweak your colors** and drop the truncation for readability.

With those changes your progress-circles will stay round, sit where you expect, and look crisp and legible‚Äîeven when you‚Äôve only got one language active. üëç
