**Explaining the errors**

The user posted errors for service-worker.js and an Express request.

1. The first error indicates that the service worker tries to cache a POST request using `cache.put` but the Cache API only supports GET requests. The fix here is to ensure that the service worker checks if the method is GET before caching a request.

2. The second error is a 500 server error from `/api/progress/lesson/.../complete`. This likely originates from the route in Express, and I'll need to check how it's implemented—likely in `storage.markLessonComplete`.

**Investigating the 500 error**

It looks like the error occurs when trying to mark the lesson as complete, resulting in a 500 status. The issue might be related to `storage.markLessonComplete`, specifically if `req.user` is undefined, possibly due to missing user authentication. Since `storage.markLessonComplete` could be failing to find a record or handle data properly, we should check server logs for more details. The Zod validation also seems unrelated since it's only used in updating progress, not completing the lesson.


Thought for 8 seconds


Here’s what’s going on:

---

## 1) `TypeError: Failed to execute 'put' on 'Cache': Request method 'POST' is unsupported`

**Why it happens:**
Your service-worker’s fetch handler is trying to do something like:

```js
// Pseudocode from your service-worker.js
caches.open(CACHE_NAME).then(cache => {
  cache.put(event.request, response.clone())
})
```

But the Cache API only allows you to cache **GET** requests. Any attempt to `cache.put()` a POST (or DELETE, PATCH, etc.) will throw exactly that error.

**How to fix it:**
Guard your caching logic so that you only cache GETs. For example:

```js
self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  // Skip all non-GET requests
  if (event.request.method !== 'GET') return;

  event.respondWith(
    caches.open(CACHE_NAME).then(cache =>
      cache.match(event.request).then(cached => {
        if (cached) return cached;
        return fetch(event.request).then(response => {
          cache.put(event.request, response.clone());
          return response;
        });
      })
    )
  );
});
```

This will stop your service worker from ever calling `cache.put()` on a POST, and the TypeError will go away.

## 2) `POST /api/progress/lesson/:lessonId/complete → 500 Internal Server Error`

Your client logs:

```
/api/progress/lesson/es-lesson01/complete:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)
progress.ts:65 Error marking lesson as completed: Error: Failed to mark lesson as completed
```

That means your Express route

```ts
router.post("/lesson/:lessonId/complete", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const progress = await storage.markLessonComplete(req.user!.id, req.params.lessonId);
    res.json(progress);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error marking lesson as complete:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ message: "Failed to mark lesson as complete" });
  }
});
```

hit an unhandled exception in `storage.markLessonComplete(...)`, which your catch block turned into a generic 500.

### How to debug

1. **Inspect the real error**
   In your server console you’ll see the full `error` object logged after

   ```txt
   Error marking lesson as complete: …
   ```

   That stack‐trace will tell you exactly whether it’s a DB client error, a “user not found,” or something else.

2. **Check `req.user`**
   In development you’re using `?testUser=1` to bypass auth. Make sure you are indeed appending `?testUser=1` to the URL when you test. If `req.user` is ever undefined, `req.user!.id` will blow up.

3. **Verify your storage function**
   Open up `storage.markLessonComplete(userId, lessonId)` and confirm that:

   * It can connect to your database
   * It finds (or creates) the progress row
   * It doesn’t violate any constraints
   * It returns a valid object

4. **Test the endpoint directly**
   Use Postman or `curl`:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/progress/lesson/es-lesson01/complete?testUser=1 \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
   ```

   and look at the JSON or error message in the response body.

Once you’ve read the actual stack-trace or error message from your server logs, you can pinpoint and fix whatever in `storage.markLessonComplete` is failing—whether it’s missing DB tables, a typo in the query, or bad schema validation.

---

### TL;DR

* **Service worker error** → you can’t cache POSTs. Wrap your `cache.put` so it only runs on GET requests.
* **500 on `/complete`** → your storage layer threw; inspect the console.log of `error` in your Express catch block to see why, then correct the DB call or auth check.

After you make those two fixes, your front-end calls to mark lessons complete (and your Settings/Profile pages) will start working again.
